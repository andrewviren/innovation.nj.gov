<p class="usa-intro">The Office of Innovation works with and across New Jersey State departments and agencies to design and develop products and services by using modern, data-driven, human-centered design and agile development processes.
</p>

## How We Work

In partnership with colleagues across the State, the Innovation Lab deploys cross-functional teams with design, development, product, and strategy expertise to solve pressing public interest challenges for the people of New Jersey. By leveraging human-centered design approaches and agile methodologies, we place the user at the center of our design process and rapidly deploy solutions that we can test and iterate upon. By doing so, we create products and services that are more effective, more efficient, and more impactful for the people of the State. We develop our products in the open and encourage you to interact with us through our Github page.
