Phil Murphy in October 2018, is charged with preparing for both the opportunities and challenges that technology will bring to the state’s workforce. The group surveyed workers earlier this year about issues relating to technology’s impact on their jobs and has completed a report on its findings.</p>

        <p>An architect would never design a house without talking to the client, yet those who govern often create policy without the meaningful input of affected residents. That is why the New Jersey Future of Work Task Force went online in February 2020 to ask New Jersey residents what they felt were the challenges that technology posed to the future of work in order to inform the Task Force’s recommendations. Nearly 4,000 responded.</p>

        <p>Greg, an IT professional with a background in accounting, business intelligence and data analytics, left his job because he wanted to quit traveling and work closer to home. Four years later, he was still looking for work when he stumbled upon the New Jersey Career Network online. He had a strong resume and he’d already identified his career goals but his periodic internet searches were not yielding positive results. “I would spend time looking everywhere,” he said in an interview, “but not really having any documentation of what I did, who I spoke to, how many resumes I sent out.”</p>

A record number of people have filed for unemployment claims as COVID-19 has ravaged the economy. Efforts to help came quickly from state leaders. And days after businesses began closing, the Murphy administration launched a new COVID-19 jobs portal.</p>
