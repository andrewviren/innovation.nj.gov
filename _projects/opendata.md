The Office of Innovation collaborates with the Governor's Office, State agencies, and other public sector stakeholders to advance the development and implementation of policy. By leveraging an approach that is data-driven, human-centered, inclusionary, and open, the Office of Innovation is able to provide key stakeholders with an innovative outlook on policy design and delivery. Our work has spanned issue areas such as economic and workforce development, public health, technology governance, open data, autonomous vehicles, and more.
