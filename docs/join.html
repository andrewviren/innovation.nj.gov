We operate in partnership with the Governor’s office, State agencies and departments, and outside partners - working differently to create innovative policies and technologies that address complex public problems.

    <p>Our team is made up of dedicated and energetic individuals with experience in government, business, civic tech, policy, and engagement. We are passionate about transforming the way government operates, and we support State agencies in innovating and improving the lives of all New Jerseyans.
