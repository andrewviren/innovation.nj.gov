    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>
      The New Jersey State Office of Innovation was created by Governor Phil Murphy in August, 2018 with the appointment of Dr. Beth Simone Noveck as the State's first-ever Chief Innovation Officer.
   </p>
   <p>The Office of Innovation was founded with the mandate to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by designing and deploying more effective and efficient government services. We work in partnership with the Governor’s Office and State agencies to create innovative policies and technologies that address complex public problems by working differently: we apply data science and public engagement to understand problems, and  we use the latest digital technologies combined with strategic policies to develop solutions that improve services while also reducing costs for the State and the taxpaying public.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our team is made up of dedicated and energetic individuals with experience in government, business, civic tech, policy, and engagement. We are passionate about transforming the way government operates, and we support State agencies in innovating and improving the lives of all New Jerseyans. We partner with teams throughout the state to design and deploy world-class, innovative, and inclusive policies and digital services that solve pressing public interest challenges. With the support of the Governor, the Chief Innovation Officer, and other senior leadership, the team uses modern practices to deliver solutions that positively impact the lives of New Jerseyans and the state’s businesses and institutions.
  </p>
  <p> Since our creation, we have engaged on a wide variety of issues, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Responding to emerging and urgent needs, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by deploying modern digital services and expanding the use and availability of data</li>
  <li>Creating tools to enable the public to participate in open policy making</li>
  <li>Making modern career services and digital tools available to support job seekers in identifying, preparing for, and obtaining family-sustaining jobs</li>
  <li>Improving the way entrepreneurs and business owners start, operate, and grow their businesses in the state</li>
  <li>Exploring policy innovations on issue areas such as economic development, technology governance, open data, open governance, autonomous vehicles, broadband, workforce development and more</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can learn more about some of our initiatives on the <a href="https://innovation.nj.gov/projects.html">project page.</a></p>
  <p>Our team operates as a startup within government, and our team members wear many hats, contributing to both the execution of core projects and the evolution of the Office of Innovation. We kickstart new initiatives and assist teammates and partners when urgent challenges arise. We use data and modern research methods to inform our decision making, and we collaborate with stakeholders within and outside of government to understand and solve challenges.</p>
  <p>We believe this mission can only be fulfilled with a diverse and inclusive team, environment, and approach. Are you interested in joining us?</p>
