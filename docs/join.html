        <h5>Business Experience Lead</h5>
        <div>
          <p>We are seeking a talented and experienced professional that will be responsible for transforming the experience of businesses interacting with the State. You’ll do this by driving the production of constantly-evolving content, getting user feedback regularly through standardized user testing, engaging with a diverse audience, and acting as a stakeholder for new technologies and interfaces through the <a href="https://innovation.nj.gov/projects.html#bfs">Business First Stop</a> initiative. The role will include elements of content creation, marketing research, user testing, experience design, communications management, and product management. You’ll be empowered outside of the standard agency structure, avoiding the trap of “shipping an org chart” and instead delivering a cohesive experience.

    <h4>About the Office of Innovation</h4>
    <p>The Office of Innovation was founded with the mandate to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by designing and deploying more effective and efficient government services. We operate in partnership with the Governor’s office, State agencies and departments, and outside partners - working differently to create innovative policies and technologies that address complex public problems. We apply data science and public engagement to understand problems, and use modern digital technologies combined with strategic policies to develop solutions that improve services while also reducing costs for the State and the taxpaying public. </p>
    <p>Our team is made up of dedicated and energetic individuals with experience in government, business, civic tech, policy, and engagement. We are passionate about transforming the way government operates, and we support State agencies in innovating and improving the lives of all New Jerseyans. We partner with teams throughout the state to design and deploy world-class, innovative, and inclusive policies and digital services that solve pressing public interest challenges. </p>

      <li>Deliver accessible solutions and policies that meet the needs of real people</li>
      <li>Succeed in a highly ambiguous environment with little definition or structure</li>
      <li>Maintain strong domain expertise while keeping a cross-functional approach l</li>
      <li>Collaborate with stakeholders in domains beyond technology such as legal, policy, and administrative roles</li>
      <li>Be committed and know how to develop metrics and experiments to test what works</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Since our creation, we have engaged in a wide variety of issues, including:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Responding to emerging and urgent needs, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by deploying modern digital services and expanding the use and availability of data</li>
      <li>Improving the delivery of benefits and services, including Unemployment Insurance and SNAP</li>
      <li>Creating tools to enable the public to participate in open policy making</li>
      <li>Making modern career services and digital tools available to support job seekers in identifying, preparing for, and obtaining family-sustaining jobs</li>
