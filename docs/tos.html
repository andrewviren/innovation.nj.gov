        <b>Introduction to this Privacy Notice</b></br>
        The New Jersey Office of Innovation (“InnovateNJ” "we", "us", "our") cares about your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, disclose,
        and otherwise use ("Process") your information. This Information Collection Statement describes our practices in connection with the information we collect
        through this Office of Innovation website ("Website").  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy practices.</br>
      </br>
        <b>Definition of Personal Information</b></br>
        For purposes of this Information Collection Statement, "Personal Information" means any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
        identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.
      </br></br>
        <b>What We Collect</b></br>

        In providing you the content on this Website, we do not collect any personal information.

        We may collect information from you when you voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you:
    </p>
        <ul class="priv-list">
          <li>Contact us with a question or request</li>
          <li>Submit a question, comment, or complaint</li>
          <li>Ask to be added to the mailing list</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="priv-text" style="padding-top: 1%;">
        We use that information solely for the purpose of responding to your request.
        We take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
        We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized
        access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately, no security system is 100% secure; thus, we cannot ensure the security of all information you
        provide to us via our services. For more information on how we secure your personal information, please visit <a href="https://www.cyber.nj.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.cyber.nj.gov/.</a>
        </br></br>
      Other information we may collect about you:
    </p>
    <ul class="priv-list">
      <li><b>Cookies:</b> Our services may use “cookies” and similar technologies (collectively, "Cookies"). Cookies are small text files that this website sends to your computer for
        record-keeping purposes and this information is stored in a file on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences
        so that we can use these to improve your next visit to our website.
        <ul class="priv-list">
     <li>  One of the purposes of cookies is to simplify the use of the website. A cookie may save a user’s login details for example,
       so that the user does not need to login every time.</li>
     <li> Cookies are also used for statistical purposes, to determine how the website is used.</li>
        </ul>
      </li></br>

    <li><b>Other Non-Personal Information:</b> In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to provide to us on our services,
    we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect certain website usage information whenever
    you visit or interact with our services. This information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view,
    and other similar information. We may use this usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve our services. In addition, we may also collect
    your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively, referred to herein as a "Device Identifier").
    A device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device, and we may identify your device by its device identifier. When analyzed, usage information helps us
    determine how our services are used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the services, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant
    and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate your device identifier or website usage information with the personal
    information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personal information.</li>
