TRENTON - Governor Phil Murphy announced today that the State of New Jersey will host NJ Connects, the first-ever state summit designed to connect minority-, women-, veteran-, and LGBTQ-owned businesses with roughly one billion dollars in public and private sector contracting opportunities. In keeping with the Governor’s commitment to build a stronger and fairer economy, the summit – taking place in Newark on September 20 – is designed to create a more robust and diverse state contracting supply chain by fostering opportunities for minority, women, veteran, and LGBTQ business enterprises (MWVBE).
