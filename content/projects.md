</p>

## How We Work

In partnership with colleagues across the State, the Office of Innovation deploys cross-functional teams with data, design, engineering, policy, product, and strategy expertise to solve pressing public interest challenges for the people of New Jersey. By leveraging human-centered design, agile methodologies, iterative policymaking, and data-driven practices, we place the user at the center of our work and rapidly create solutions that we can test and iterate upon. We work alongside New Jerseyans to ensure that we create products, services, and policies that are more effective, more efficient, and more impactful for the people of the State. We work in the open and encourage you to interact with us through our Github page and contact us with any questions.
