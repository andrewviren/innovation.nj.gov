Virginia Folgado Marco is an Eagleton Science and Politics Fellow with the Office of Innovation. She is a biomedical scientist with a broader background in health care and education. In her role at the Office of Innovation, Virginia is evaluating the State of New Jersey’s COVID-19 contact tracing program, with a focus on identifying areas of improvement to ensure the State has the best tools available to reduce the spread of the virus.

Prior to joining the Office of Innovation, Virginia conducted research to study the roles of ribosomal proteins in development, aging, cancer, and blood production as part of her Ph.D. dissertation. During that time, she was also part of the pre-clinical board at the Einstein Community Health Outreach Free Clinic, where she served as Spanish Consultant. In that role, she conducted research on best practices for doctor-patient-interpreter interactions, and helped double the number of Spanish interpreters in the clinic. Additionally, as an international researcher, Virginia led the INet NYC team in coordinating and organizing events and symposia to increase career development opportunities for foreign scientists in the broader New York area.

Virginia received her Master’s and Ph.D. degrees in Biomedical Sciences from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and obtained her undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from University of Valencia, in Spain. Outside of work, Virginia enjoys reading and traveling, and is especially looking forward to visiting as many national parks as possible.
