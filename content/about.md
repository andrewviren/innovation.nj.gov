<p class="usa-intro">Our mission is to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by solving public problems differently.</p>

The New Jersey State Office of Innovation was created by Governor Phil Murphy in August, 2018 with the appointment of Dr. Beth Simone Noveck as the State's first-ever Chief Innovation Officer.

Founded with the mandate to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by designing and deploying more effective and efficient government services, the Office of Innovation works in partnership with the Governorâ€™s Office and State agencies to create innovative policies and technologies that address complex public problems by working differently. We apply data science and public engagement to understand problems, and use modern digital technologies combined with strategic policies to develop solutions that improve services while also reducing costs for the State and the taxpaying public.

## How We Work + What We Do

The Office of Innovation works collaboratively with government, academic, non-profit, and private sector institutions to drive innovation in the Garden State and improve the design and delivery of policies and services to the state's residents, businesses, and institutions.
