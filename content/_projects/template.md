[A simple topline description of what the project is]

### Challenge
- The “why.” A brief summary of the project with a focus on the problem we’re trying to solve. 

### Innovation In Action
- How we’re doing things differently and how our approach/philosophy differs. In other words, this is a chance to showcase how our innovativeness is a break from the status quo and allows us to deliver better solutions. In particular, this is aimed at highlighting the innovation or approach that made our solution possible (e.g. open sourcing problem solving, user first, data-driven, iterative, etc.)

### Impact + Metrics
- Drop in metrics or for projects/initiatives without metrics, we can talk about accomplishments, concrete steps, or the results
  - Example: For the Future of Work Task Force, it could be “Released detailed report with XX recommendations, Launched inaugural cohort of Future of Work Accelerator with xx businesses, etc.”
- For website, at a minimum, we should include 1) Users, 2) Sessions, 3) Pageview, but frame these metrics in a manner that connects the project to the impact these metrics elicit (e.g. “The Information Hub has connected more than XXXX people with key information about state services, rules, regulations, benefits and more”

### Status
