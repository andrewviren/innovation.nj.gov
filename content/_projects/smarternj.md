SmarterNJ is an open government platform that empowers New Jerseyans to engage on a wide variety of policy issues. To make policies even more effective, we need to tap the State’s most valuable assets: the intelligence, expertise, and know-how of its people. That's why the SmarterNJ initiative is focused on creating new and innovative ways for the public to meaningfully contribute to the policymaking process.

Through tailored public consultations—developed in partnership with State departments and agencies—the SmarterNJ platform enables the public to submit ideas for government-led, prize-backed challenges, contribute their thoughts and insights regarding policy issues and proposals, and provide feedback on the implementation of policy and programs to ensure that public services are working as intended.

The first project to launch under the SmarterNJ initiative was the [Innovation ENJINE Challenge](https://smarter.nj.gov/enjine/)—an open innovation challenge that leveraged the hard-earned knowledge of State employees to make government more effective and efficient. [Your Future of Work](https://smarter.nj.gov/fow/index.html)—a problem identification consultation—was launched in partnership with the New Jersey Future of Work Task Force, and concluded in February of 2020.
