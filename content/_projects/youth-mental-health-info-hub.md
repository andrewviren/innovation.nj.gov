New Jersey’s [Youth Mental Health Information Hub](http://youthhelp.nj.gov) is a central source of information for young adults struggling with mental health challenges. The site features critical information in a simple, user-friendly format.

### Challenge:
 Even before the pandemic upended our lives, young adults were faced with a mental health crisis which has only grown. Studies show mental health hospitalizations have [increased](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debgordon/2022/09/30/the-kids-are-not-alright-new-report-shows-pediatric-mental-health-hospitalizations-rose-61/?sh=2ca1dd5c7eb7) 61% for children under age 19 over the last five years, and [suicide](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/t.e2ma.net/click/33xdbi/7ys5259b/vp5fk0__;!!J30X0ZrnC1oQtbA!JrZJmlJe9lvVua_4EuDxxz2JEUpw6pf3J1XpCU0fHFLDGcvYZckl090-XguBM86KKvc66yePa9b23EQl_pBFFpm2$) is now the second leading cause of death for 10- to 24-year-olds. While the State has resources to help young adults, they are scattered across agency websites making them difficult to find, particularly in a moment of crisis.

### Innovation In Action:
 Rather than relying on assumptions, OOI conducted surveys and worked with advocacy organizations to inform the Information Hub’s content and design. Surveys, learnings, and insights gathered through the research process informed how OOI identified, consolidated and organized essential resources from multiple sites across government and service organizations. The site will continue to be updated based on ongoing user testing and feedback.
