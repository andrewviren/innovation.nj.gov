At the onset of the public health crisis, the Office of Innovation rapidly created a new website to serve as a central information hub on all matters related to COVID-19. The site features constantly updated information in English and Spanish on what resources are available to help New Jerseyans through the pandemic, the latest on business regulations and safety guidance, and [scientific content](https://covid19.fas.org/) from the Federation of American Scientists. This project was developed in partnership with Yext, which has offered its services to the Office of Innovation on a pro bono basis.

The COVID-19 Information Hub also features a [testing site locator](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/testing) and a [symptom self-assessment tool](https://self.covid19.nj.gov/) where New Jerseyans can check their symptoms and learn what to do if they believe they may have COVID-19. The tool has also provided public health officials with anonymized data to inform predictive analytics and help anticipate where the virus may spread.

Due to the wide-ranging and unprecedented economic impact of COVID-19, a [Jobs Portal](https://jobs.covid19.nj.gov) was rapidly created and deployed on the Information Hub to help connect the hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans who lost their jobs with employment opportunities provided by essential businesses. The Information Hub is closely linked to the [Business Information Hub](https://cv.business.nj.gov/) that serves as a dedicated resource for New Jerseyâ€™s business community.
