**Lifelong Learning Accounts**

Lifelong Learning Accounts (LiLA) is one of the nation’s first pilot programs that will provide residents with unrestricted funds to be used for job training, education, career coaching, job search assistance, and wraparound services such as childcare, eldercare, transportation to training, and more. The pilot program stems from the New Jersey State Future of Work Task Force.

**Challenge:** Disruptive new technologies are changing the economy, eliminating the need for some jobs while creating new ones altogether. To adapt, workers need new skills, which requires training and education. Research from the [Future of Work Task Force](https://fowtf.innovation.nj.gov/resources.html) found that many workers lack access to training, and many employers do not provide or fund significant training opportunities. Workers also face additional barriers to accessing training, such as limited financial resources to pay for child or eldercare that would be required for them to participate in upskilling or training programs outside of work.

**Innovation In Action:** Unlike many assistance programs, Lifelong Learning Accounts enable residents to focus resources on overcoming the barriers specific to their lives. Research has shown that allowing individuals to manage spending decisions, rather than the government, creates the greatest impact. Residents in need of up-skilling later in their careers are more likely to have families and other financial obligations and time commitments that make training more difficult. By allowing residents to use funds for wrap-around services like childcare, LiLA enables a broader pool of the workforce to engage in up-skilling.

**Impact + Metrics**

- Governor Murphy and the Legislature have set aside $10 million to create this first-of-its-kind Lifelong Learning Account pilot for qualifying New Jerseyans who are long-term unemployed or employed residents that qualify as Asset Limited Income Constrained.

**Status**

- The pilot program is projected to launch in the Summer of 2023 and run for a period of two years.

**Future of Work Accelerator**

The Future of Work Accelerator was a 9-month program that advanced innovations aimed at enhancing the lives of New Jersey’s workers by improving health and safety, increasing access to benefits, strengthening training opportunities, and bolstering worker voice. The program brought together local and national innovators, providing them with coaching, masterclasses, and access to funders to help develop and scale innovations in the Garden State.

**Challenge:** New Jersey’s Future of Work Task Force identified key ways in which technology might impact the lives and livelihoods of New Jerseyans. At the same time, the Task Force recognized that the breadth of impact required participation from non-governmental actors to contribute to solving challenges arising from changes in technology. To address these impacts, the State needed to identify and accelerate the development of solutions to help workers.

**Innovation In Action:** To address such a broad challenge, there was a need to encourage innovative solutions beyond government – and across industries and disciplines – to support workers. In addition to providing innovators with workshops, mentoring, and connections to funders and potential State partners/resources, the Future of Work Accelerator also created a community of social entrepreneurs dedicated to helping residents. The FOW Accelerator was made possible through philanthropic funding.

**Impact + Metrics**

- In 2022, the inaugural class comprising 20 diverse organizations, including nonprofits, startups, worker cooperatives, businesses, and local governments, successfully completed the program. . [Meet the class.](https://medium.com/njinnovation/assembling-the-future-of-work-accelerators-inaugural-cohort-a5d020c92a27)

**Future of Work Policy + Practice Catalog**

The Future of Work [Policy & Practice Catalog ](https://fow.innovation.nj.gov/)– developed as a tool for the Future of Work Task Force – aggregated leading research, policies, and practices on how to respond to the challenges and opportunities created by the impact of new technology on work. The searchable database collected research so Future of Work Task Force members and other decisions-makers could easily view ideas from numerous studies in a single, easy to use format.

**Challenge:** The Future of Work Task Force needed a mechanism to review relevant research, policies, and approaches related to the future of work, and evaluate approaches to create a more resilient workforce and spur the creation of good jobs. Every year new research is produced on the topic, and this growing body of work is scattered across reports, articles, and studies, making it difficult for policy makers to stay up to date and make use of this knowledge.

**Innovation In Action:** OOI partnered with academia to review dozens of reports, articles, and policies related to the future of work and compiled that information into a searchable and sortable format. The catalog was made publicly accessible so that other policy-makers and researchers – in addition to FOW Task Force members – could quickly access material relevant to their communities and interests, including concrete responses to technological advancement for use by government, companies, educational institutions and unions. Each proposal includes a short description and examples where it has been implemented.

**Impact + Metrics**

- The Catalog has more than 23,000 unique pageviews since its launch in 2019.

**Status**

- The FOW Policy + Practice Catalog is no longer actively maintained.

**Algorithmic Hiring Education Initiative**

At the recommendation of the Future Of Work Task Force, OOI is exploring an education initiative about the risks of algorithmic hiring tools that can inadvertently introduce discrimination and limit diversity in hiring.

**Challenge:** In an effort to reduce individual biases, employers often rely on algorithms to help make hiring decisions, screen candidates, and even administer interviews. However, studies have found that these algorithms may actually reinforce existing biases, penalizing candidates who identify as women, people of color, or those with disabilities, as well as those who attended certain schools or dress in a certain way.

**Innovation In Action:** OOI has deployed a research-backed and multi-disciplinary approach to exploring this problem area, while also tapping outside experts and academia to deepen the State’s understanding of the public policy challenges that algorithmic hiring tools present.

**Impact + Metrics**

- OOI continues to coordinate research and support for combating algorithmic bias within government and the private sector.

**Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool**

The [Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool](http://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/timeline) helps expecting parents plan when and how to take their maternity leave by providing a personalized calendar of how much leave time they have with State benefits. This work is part of the Resident Experience Initiative.

**Challenge:** Most people who work in New Jersey qualify for paid leave benefits under Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance. However, to use these benefits, parents must navigate a complex application process, tracking multiple details and making calculations on their own, increasing the likelihood of making a mistake during the application process or delaying access to the benefit.

**Innovation In Action:** Working closely with community partners and expecting parents to understand their needs, OOI saw an opportunity to use technology to simplify a confusing aspect of family leave and reduce stress. After asking parents a series of questions, the tool automatically provides start and end dates for leave based on their specific circumstances and preferences, giving parents clarity about the benefits they can access and when.

**Impact + Metrics**

- As of May 2023, 62,300 New Jerseyans have used the Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool to understand their benefits; and 54,690 timelines have been created (since launch of the tool in May 2022).

**Status**

- The tool officially launched in July 2022, and is undergoing iterative improvements based on user feedback and data.

**Training Explorer**

The Training Explorer is a tool that uses public sector data to help job seekers find the best training programs for their needs. Using the tool, residents can easily filter and compare more than 5,000 training programs from across New Jersey to make data-informed choices about their future.

**Challenge:** When it comes to training programs, there is no shortage of choice for those seeking to start a career, find a new one, or level up their skills. The prospect of spending hours poring through multiple sites to find the right one, and comparing the relative strengths of each program can be overwhelming. The lack of data about potential outcomes or consistency across programs makes these difficult decisions even harder.

**Innovation In Action:** Using open data, OOI collaborated with the New Jersey Department of Labor to create the first interactive, comprehensive list of all schools and organizations in New Jersey offering subsidized workforce training. With this data, OOI has empowered training seekers to use data and evidence to help choose a training program that’s right for them. By standardizing metrics for over 5,000 programs, the Training Explorer provides residents with information like a clear cost breakdown for each program, projections for how much they can earn after finishing a program, information on the likelihood of getting a job, and more. With an understanding that no two training seekers are the same, users are able to filter which programs are wheelchair accessible, provide child care assistance, teach in different languages, or have evening classes.

**Impact + Metrics**

- The Training Explorer was the first major update to the State’s training portal in over two decades. Residents now have access to a comprehensive list of subsidized workforce trainings in a bilingual, searchable, and mobile-friendly interface.
- Residents no longer need to visit multiple websites to learn about NJ DOL-approved trainings, and now get personalized, data-backed recommendations.

**Status**

- OOI is continuing to build additional features for the Training Explorer including more filters, multi-language support, and integration with related workforce tools.

**NJ Career Central Hub**

OOI is working with the NJ Department of Labor and other project partners to build the NJ Career Central Hub: a digital “front door” for all jobseekers that houses several new tools including an AI-powered guide that provides personalized career recommendations, a resource to organize job search activities into manageable steps, and a comprehensive, searchable list of all subsidized training programs. This work is now part of the Resident Experience initiative.

**Challenge**: Finding a job or changing careers is often a daunting task - it’s stressful, confusing, and frustrating. Job seekers have a multiple resources that they can access in different ways and places, and there is no single "right career path.” This challenge necessitates career support that’s tailored to the individual and their needs, and to ensure that New Jersey residents have the tools and opportunities to succeed.

**Innovation In Action:** The NJ Career Central Hub provides personalized guides and data-drives recommendations for job seekers. Supported by AI and machine learning that analyzes 8 million wage records from individuals, NJ Career Central Hub guides users by providing insights into how transitions between industries and differences in degrees, certifications, and credentials can impact future wages. Users are provided with quality job listings, personalized job recommendations, workforce skills identification, and subsidized training opportunities when applicable.

**Impact + Metrics**

- OOI is providing New Jersey workers with simple, straightforward ways to explore careers, training opportunities, and job openings in a range of industries.

**Status**

- The NJ Career Central Hub soft launched in the Fall of 2022 and is undergoing user testing for further refinement including digital career coaching tools and multi-language support.

**Communication + Engagement Lab**

The Communication and Engagement Lab (C+E Lab) is an initiative that aims to modernize and enhance the State’s ability to better connect New Jersey’s residents and institutions to State programs, resources, and services through the use of data, research, and modern consumer marketing techniques.

**Challenge:** Government programs and services often lack adequate resources to reach audiences at scale. A lack of government capacity to deploy new tools, social and behavioral research, and data-driven insights means eligible residents often do not know about the programs and services intended to serve them.

**Innovation In Action:** The C+E Lab moves residents to take action by using proven consumer marketing techniques and data. Rather than relying on assumptions, the C+E Lab conducts research and leverages data to understand consumer motivations and then uses those learnings to craft strategies that meets consumers where they are and ultimately move them to action. This strategic approach differs from traditional government communications efforts as it is guided by research and focused on impact.

**Impact + Metrics**

- The C+E Lab supported the successful launch and ongoing optimization of Business.NJ.gov’s first paid media campaign. The campaign is increasing the user base of Business.NJ.gov and is providing learning around channels, tactics, and creative execution. The campaign is also enabling us to create an understanding on if our efforts are equitable in their reach.
- The C+E Lab advised and supported OSHE to develop a paid media campaign designed to connect residents to the State’s Some College, No Degree initiative. The campaign will launch in late August and create “leads”, residents that indicate they are interested in learning more about the SCND initiative, that a State procured vendor will work to enroll.
- The C+E Lab conducted research for State Library that identified a perception problem with residents who stopped visiting the Library in-person. Once residents became aware of the services the Library provides, it created intent to return. Library used our findings to develop a new campaign that is driving residents back into the Library again.

**Status**

- The C+E Lab was launched in early 2022 and has conducted several engagements with State teams and agencies. In 2023, the Lab seeks to launch two high-impact marketing campaigns with its State partners.

**OSHE Some College, No Degree Campaign**

The Office of Innovation is working with the NJ Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE) to launch a campaign encouraging New Jersey students, who started college, but left before finishing their degree, to return. This work is being undertaken by the C+E Lab.

**Challenge**: Roughly 1 million New Jerseyans have started college, but stopped before completing their degree. The State, led by OSHE, has launched a suite of financial assistance and coaching tools to help these individuals to return to school and earn their degree.

**Innovation In Action:** To help the OSHE project team persuade non-returning students to re-enroll in higher education, the C+E Lab is tasked with helping create a marketing campaign to drive awareness and uptake of these programs and services. The C+E lab conducted ethnographic research to understand the target audience’s underlying motivations. This research then informed the creation of a communication strategy that will ultimately move these individuals to return to college and complete their degree.

**Impact + Metrics:**

- The C+E Lab’s research shifted OSHE’s understanding of their target audience, and revealed that the State’s approach would not motivate students to return and could be potentially alienating.
- Based on its research, the Lab developed a communication strategy that reframed the State’s narrative and recommended media channels and budgets to meet the audience where they are – particularly underserved communities.
- Also based on its research, the Lab developed creative concepts that brought the communication strategy to life, and quantitatively validated the concepts as most effective in creating awareness and intent.

**Status:**

- The C+E Lab is leading the development of creative assets that will support the launch of the SCND paid media campaign in late August. We will continue to provide advisory support to OSHE through the end of the SCND campaign in December.

**Business.NJ.Gov Digital Marketing Beta Campaign**

The C+E Lab worked with the Business.NJ.gov team to launch and short-term digital marketing campaign to boost traffic to its site and gain initial learnings about marketing performance opportunities

**Challenge:** The Business.NJ.gov team relies on user testing and site data to inform their work. But web traffic on Business.NJ.gov had stagnated, hampering the development of new products and features due to an insufficient amount of incoming data. So the C+E Lab was tasked with increasing traffic to the site to accelerate learnings.

**Innovation In Action:** The C+E Lab developed a 6-week, multichannel campaign to increase site traffic and drive learnings. The Lab’s comprehensive services included creative concept development, the creation of creative assets, multichannel planning, establishing a test and learn framework, and setting up a data dashboard to monitor the campaign in real time. Prior to the C+E Lab, the State would have needed to outsource these tasks to a marketing agency, but with the Lab, it now has those advanced capabilities in-house.

**Impact + Metrics**

- The C+E Lab’s campaign increased site traffic during +37% Year Over Year since launch, with 39% of the traffic consisting of audiences new to Business.NJ.gov.

**Transgender Information Hub**

The [Transgender Information Hub](http://transgender.nj.gov) is a central resource for the transgender and non-binary community in New Jersey that provides guidance and answers to common questions. The site features critical information from nearly a dozen agencies in a supportive, user-friendly format.

**Challenge:** For transgender and non-binary New Jerseyans, basic actions like updating a name or gender marker on official documents can be unexpectedly challenging and potentially traumatizing. Antiquated policies required individuals to get medical documentation and navigate a complex web of local, state, and federal requirements. The Governor and the legislature passed new laws to remove these barriers and protect the privacy of transgender individuals, however outdated information continues to circulate online. Yet, without a central source of information, transgender and non-binary individuals still needed to sift through multiple state agencies and departments to obtain basic services.

**Innovation In Action:** To ensure the needs of transgender and non-binary New Jerseyans were met, OOI used a data-driven and user-centered approach by first conducting a user-needs survey to understand the most pressing needs and concerns. OOI partnered with advocacy and service-based organizations throughout the state to both amplify the survey, and gain insights. Additionally, numerous user-testing sessions further informed the site’s content and design. Rather than a static website, the Transgender Information Hub’s design, organization, and content continues to be updated based on user data and feedback to better serve residents.

**Impact + Metrics**

- For the first time, transgender New Jerseyans have a government resource dedicated to simplifying critical services and no longer need to spend hours visiting multiple sites.

**Status**

- In early 2023, a beta version of the Transgender Information Hub was launched, and is currently undergoing user-testing and further refinement based on feedback.

**Disabilities Information Hub**

New Jersey’s Disabilities Information Hub will serve as a central source of information for individuals with disabilities and their families and caregivers. The site will consolidate critical information from dozens of agencies in a user-friendly format on a range of topics from health care to utility assistance, transportation to in-home support, and more.

**Challenge:** There are a multitude of state programs that support people with disabilities, however finding and accessing them can be a challenge as they are largely organized by the agency responsible for administering the program. In practice, that means poring over dozens of different state websites to find information which increases the likelihood that users may not get the information or help they need.

**Innovation In Action:** Building on the model pioneered by the COVID-19 Information Hub, OOI is building the Disabilities Information Hub around specific user needs rather than organizing information by government agency. In addition, to ensure users’ needs are fully met, OOI is employing an iterative, data-driven and human-centered approach. In practice, this means OOI first conducted a survey and worked with advocacy organizations to understand the most pressing needs and challenges of New Jerseyans with disabilities. Throughout the development process, the site’s content and design will continually be revised based on user testing and feedback. Given the hub’s intended audience, OOI is also working closely with accessibility experts to optimize the site’s accessibility for all users.

**Impact + Metrics**

- When the Disabilities Hub launches, New Jerseyans with disabilities and their families and caregivers will no longer have to navigate a maze of state agencies and instead will have an easy to use, centralized portal for all their needs.

The site features easily-accessible, actionable information to help students with food, housing, childcare, transportation, and overcoming other barriers to continuing their pursuit of higher education.

**Challenge:** Many college students – particularly low-income people of color – struggle to meet their basic needs including getting enough to eat and even accessing adequate housing. This hampers academic performance and forces many to drop out. While there are programs available to help, they are scattered across multiple agency websites and students may not be aware of their ability to access these vital resources.

**Innovation In Action:** Building on the model pioneered by the COVID-19 Information Hub, OOI built the College Support Resource Hub around the specific needs of college students rather than organizing information by government agency. To ensure users’ needs are met, OOI used an iterative, data-first design philosophy that prioritized first understanding students’ greatest needs. In addition, the hub’s content, design, and organization will continue to be revised based on user testing and feedback.

**Vaccine Hesitancy Email Campaign**

*Following the release of the first-ever COVID-19 vaccine, the Office of Innovation, in partnership with NJ Department of Health and numerous other partners, developed and implemented a statwide eight message email campaign designed to address vaccine hesitancy concerns.*

***Challenge***

●

**Innovation In Action**

- The Office of Innovation worked with academic partners and public health experts to research key motivations that drove people’s decision-making regarding whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This research was further informed by several A/B tests to validate and iterate on the campaign’s proposed approaches. To increase the campaign’s reach, OOI also coordinated across State departments and agencies to leverage pre-existing distribution channels to connect with a broader, more diverse audience.

**Impact + Metrics**

- The vaccine hesitancy campaign reached 5.4 million New Jerseyans; a total of 41.8 million emails were sent, generating more than 18.7 million impressions
- More 5 million subscribers stayed engaged throughout the campaign, with only 5% of the total the audience unsubscribing at any point.
- The email campaign directly drove more than 132,000 visits to the State’s Vaccine Appointment Finder, as well as more than 200,000 additional visits to the COVID-19 Information Hub
- During the campaign timeline, 803,000 additional New Jerseyans became fully vaccinated

**Data + Policy Team**

*[Note: The overarching goal of the redesign is to simplify the project section, give a clear understanding of each project, underscore how OOI works differently than other departments]*

**PROJECT NAME**

*[A simple topline description of what the project is]*

***Challenge***

- The “why.” A brief summary of the project with a focus on the problem we’re trying to solve.

**Innovation In Action**

- How we’re doing things differently and how our approach/philosophy differs. In other words, this is a chance to showcase how our innovativeness is a break from the status quo and allows us to deliver better solutions. In particular, this is aimed at highlighting the innovation or approach that made our solution possible (e.g. open sourcing problem solving, user first, data-driven, iterative, etc.)

**Impact + Metrics**

- Drop in metrics or for projects/initiatives without metrics, we can talk about accomplishments, concrete steps, or the results
- Example: For the Future of Work Task Force, it could be “Released detailed report with XX recommendations, Launched inaugural cohort of Future of Work Accelerator with xx businesses, etc.”

**Status**

- Where things stand with the project. What are the next steps? Where are we heading?
- If the project has wrapped, we can link to “what we learned” blog posts.

**Resources and Additional Information**

- Git hubs, news about the work, writing about the work
