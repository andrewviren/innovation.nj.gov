title: User-Centered and Data-Driven Product Development
---

The Office of Innovation works with State departments and agencies to serve residents more effectively by improving public-facing digital products. At the heart of every project we undertake is the core principle of user-centered design and a data driven approach that prioritizes the needs of New Jerseyans. For instance, the Office of Innovation recently worked with the New Jersey Department of Labor (DOL) to build a [benefits eligibility tool](https://getstarted.nj.gov/labor/) that helps New Jerseyans more easily discover and apply for benefit programs and financial assistance. The aim of the user-centered design project was to simplify an individualâ€™s interaction with DOL, streamline the process of applying for benefits, and ultimately better serve those in need.

Similarly, the Office of Innovation worked with the Department of Health to create an [online COVID-19 symptom checker](https://self.covid19.nj.gov/). In addition to providing New Jerseyans with a self-assessment tool to help guide their decisions during the pandemic, the tool anonymously collected data, providing public health officials valuable insight into where the virus may spread. Meanwhile, as part of the NJ Career Network and Business First Stop initiatives, our office is helping to develop digital tools that offer the State a way to better support job seekers and businesses.
