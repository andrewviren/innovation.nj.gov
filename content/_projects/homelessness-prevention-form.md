title: NJ Eviction and Homelessness Prevention Certification Form
menu-group: COVID Response
---

### Challenge

In preparation for the end of the State's eviction moratorium, New Jersey introduced protections for low-income renters who struggled during the pandemic. Those who qualify can submit a self-certification form to their landlords, and for those with pending legal actions against them can submit the form to NJ Courts.

### Innovation In Action

To ensure residents in need could stay in their homes, OOI created an easy-to-use online form that makes the process as seamless as possible. The interactive tool guides users through the process with a series of questions, automatically generates their self-certification form, and with back-end data sharing, users only need to fill out their information once and can share it with all relevant agencies.

### Impact + Metrics

-   In 2022, over 70,000 residents used the Eviction Protection Tool.

### Status

-   The tool remains active and continues to be updated as needed.

### Key Partners

-   NJ Department of Community Affairs
-   NJ Courts
