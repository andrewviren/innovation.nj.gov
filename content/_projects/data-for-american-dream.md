The New Jersey Data for the American Dream (D4AD) initiative seeks to empower those in under-resourced communities with the right tools and guidance to get a job, propel their careers, safeguard their progress, and limit unnecessary costs.

To that end, D4AD is creating a smart disclosure tool based on an expanded set of open education and training data. Lack of open data relating to training and employment poses a challenge for job seekers, employers, and government regulators alike. It is not always clear if training programs address a job seekerâ€™s professional needs, whether the knowledge and skills acquired in the program are what employers need, or whether the program is accessible to those who need it most.

The tool will address these challenges and will be available to the public, but will be specifically designed with and for people from disadvantaged populations. The tool will exist as a standalone resource and also be linked to the New Jersey Career Network, the larger set of digital tools being developed for job seekers in the Garden State.

D4AD is a collaborative effort between the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Office of Innovation, the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, the New Jersey Council on Community Colleges, the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education, and the New Jersey Department of Education.
