The [College Support Resource Hub](https://www.info.nj.gov/basicneeds) is a central source of information for college students in New Jersey who need support with meeting their basic needs. The site features easily-accessible, actionable information to help students with food, housing, childcare, transportation, and overcoming other barriers to continuing their pursuit of higher education.

### Challenge:
 Many college students – particularly low-income people of color – struggle to meet their basic needs including getting enough to eat and even accessing adequate housing. This hampers academic performance and forces many to drop out. While there are programs available to help, they are scattered across multiple agency websites and students may not be aware of their ability to access these vital resources.

### Innovation In Action:
 Building on the model pioneered by the COVID-19 Information Hub, OOI built the College Support Resource Hub around the specific needs of college students rather than organizing information by government agency. To ensure users’ needs are met, OOI used an iterative, data-first design philosophy that prioritized first understanding students’ greatest needs. In addition, the hub’s content, design, and organization will continue to be revised based on user testing and feedback.

### Impact + Metrics

- For the first time, college students in New Jersey have a government resource dedicated to simplifying critical services and no longer need to spend hours visiting multiple sites.

### Status

- In early 2023, a beta version of the College Support Resource Hub was launched and is currently undergoing user-testing and further refinement based on feedback.

### Partners

- NJ State Office of the Secretary of Higher Education
