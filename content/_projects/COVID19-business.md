The Business Information Hub at [cv.business.nj.gov](https://cv.business.nj.gov/) was rapidly deployed at the start of the COVID-19 crisis to offer a definitive source of information for New Jersey businesses. The Business Info Hub also includes live-chat assistance, provided by the State’s Business Action Center, for businesses that have additional questions or require information clarifications.

Content on the Business Information Hub is updated daily in English and Spanish with the latest information from the Governor’s executive orders and detailed safety guidance for businesses. As the public health crisis evolves, the interagency content process and cooperation put into place during the emergency will be incorporated into [Business.NJ.gov](https://business.nj.gov/) to power the site.
