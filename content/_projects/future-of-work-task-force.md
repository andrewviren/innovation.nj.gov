title: Future of Work Task Force
---

The Future of Work Task Force, which is chaired by Chief Innovation Officer Beth Simone Noveck, was formed in October 2018 with Governor Phil Murphy's signing of Executive Order 41. The Task Force is charged with studying how technological innovation will impact the development of jobs and New Jersey’s economy and producing a comprehensive policy roadmap to prepare and protect New Jerseyans from disruptive changes.

The Task Force's planned work includes: (1) determining which technologies will impact work in New Jersey, and in particular which industries and sectors will be affected; (2) identifying the groups of residents likely to be most affected by these changes and how effects will vary based on differing demographics, including gender, race, income, location, and education; (3) exploring the ways in which the same innovative technologies might improve workplace conditions, create different jobs, and grow the State’s economy; and, (4) devising innovative, impactful, and cost-effective strategies that State government, universities, private corporations, non-profits, and individuals can employ to prepare for these changes and ensure a prosperous and equitable future.
