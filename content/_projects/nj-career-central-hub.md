title: NJ Career Central Hub
initiative: Resident Experience Initiative
---


OOI is working with the NJ State Department of Labor and other project partners to build the NJ Career Central Hub: a digital “front door” for all jobseekers that houses several new tools including an AI-powered guide that provides personalized career recommendations, a resource to organize job search activities into manageable steps, and a comprehensive, searchable list of all subsidized training programs. This work is now part of the Resident Experience initiative.

### Challenge
 Finding a job or changing careers is often a daunting task - it’s stressful, confusing, and frustrating. Job seekers have multiple resources that they can access in different ways and places, and there is no single "right career path.” This challenge necessitates career support that’s tailored to the individual and their needs, and to ensure that New Jersey residents have the tools and opportunities to succeed.

### Innovation In Action
 The NJ Career Central Hub provides personalized guides and data-drives recommendations for job seekers. Supported by AI and machine learning that analyzes 8 million wage records from individuals, NJ Career Central Hub guides users by providing insights into how transitions between industries and differences in degrees, certifications, and credentials can impact future wages. Users are provided with quality job listings, personalized job recommendations, workforce skills identification, and subsidized training opportunities when applicable.

### Impact + Metrics

- OOI is providing New Jersey workers with simple, straightforward ways to explore careers, training opportunities, and job openings in a range of industries.

### Status

- The NJ Career Central Hub soft launched in the Fall of 2022 and is undergoing user testing for further refinement including digital career coaching tools and multi-language support.
