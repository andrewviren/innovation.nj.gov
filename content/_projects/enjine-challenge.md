The Innovation ENJINE Challenge is an open innovation competition, launched in Spring 2019, to elicit unique perspectives and ideas to make government more effective and efficient from those closest to it: State employees.

In the first stage, employees submitted ideas for new policies and practices that would result in direct cost savings, more streamlined processes, or better services for the people of New Jersey. Over 2,000 participants joined, and the twenty most impactful and implementable proposals, as voted for by their fellow employees, advanced to stage two.

In the second stage, employees were invited to compete - either as individuals or in teams - in crafting a plan for how to implement one of those twenty winning ideas. In December 2019, the five winning plans were announced, and the Office of Innovation has been working closely with these teams to develop and implement their proposals.

One proposal, the creation of a user-friendly chatbot to automate assistance on websites to combat long phone wait times and limited in-person opening hours, has already been implemented on the NJ Department of Laborâ€™s site.
