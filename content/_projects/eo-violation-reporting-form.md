title: Executive Order Violation Reporting Form
menu-group: COVID Response
---

### Challenge

To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ease the strain on hospitals in the early stages of the pandemic, Governor Murphy issued several Executive Orders requiring health and safety measures at essential businesses, limits on gatherings, indoor mask requirements, the closure of non-essential businesses, and other protections. Unfortunately, some establishments did not follow these safety measures even after being warned and continued to jeopardize public health and safety.

### Innovation In Action

To reduce the strain on the State's call centers, OOI created an online tool to streamline the reporting process. Online submissions were then shared with the Office of Emergency Management and the Office of the Attorney General to follow up.

### Impact + Metrics

-   Using the tool, residents have reported more than 65,000 EO violations.

### Status

-   The reporting form remains active, however many of the COVID-related Executive Orders have been rescinded as part of the State's reopening.

### Key Partners

-   NJ Office of the Attorney General
-   NJ Office of Emergency Management
