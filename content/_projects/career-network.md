New Jersey Career Network ([NJCN](https://njcareers.org/)) is an initiative developed in partnership with the New Jersey Department of Labor and the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. NJCN is an intelligent platform that is backed by academic research, validation by expert coaches, and user research that builds job seekersâ€™ skills and confidence. NJCN guides job seekers through their day to-day job search process in order to find a meaningful career by providing personalized structure, tools, resources, and access to interventions.

The beta version of New Jersey Career Network was released in January, 2020 and incorporates a modern, mobile-responsive website that will eventually guide job-seekers to career services and digital tools such as virtual coaching, lifelong learning opportunities, and career management tools, as well as an expert system to match job seekers and other users to the programs and services most relevant to them based on where they are in their job search journey.
