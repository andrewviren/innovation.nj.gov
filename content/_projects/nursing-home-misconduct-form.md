As part of a statewide investigation into potential misconduct at nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals can report illegal activity or other misconduct to the NJ Attorney Generalâ€™s Office using the [Nursing Home Misconduct Reporting Form](https://covid19.nj.gov/ltc).

### Challenge

As part of a statewide investigation into potential misconduct at nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals can report illegal activity or other misconduct to the NJ Attorney General's Office using the Nursing Home Misconduct Reporting Form.

### Innovation In Action

OOI created an online form for the NJ Attorney General's Office that allowed individuals to submit photos, documents, and other evidence of wrongdoing. Users were able to submit information anonymously or could choose to identify themselves to help further the investigation.

### Impact + Metrics

-   By the end of 2021, more than 300 complaints of nursing home misconduct were filed through the reporting form.

### Status

-   Deployed as a pandemic response project, the nursing home misconduct form is no longer active.

### Key Partners
