New Jersey COVID-19 Information Hub
===================================

To improve access to information during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NJ Office of Innovation launched [COVID19.NJ.gov](https://covid19.nj.gov/), a centralized site that presented critical information from dozens of agencies in a user-friendly format.

Challenge: At the onset of the pandemic, there was no centralized source for official State information about the virus. Residents had to comb through dozens of State websites to learn about restrictions on gatherings, public health guidance, business closures, or unemployment benefits. As a result, New Jerseyans struggled to find the information they needed and were more susceptible to rumors and misinformation.

Innovation In Action: Unlike traditional legacy government websites, which feature static content and press releases, OOI puts the user first and deploys data to identify residents' needs and serve up relevant content in simple language to connect people with the information they need. Site content and layout are constantly updated based on frequent reviews of search data, user-submitted questions, and website behavior to proactively identify emerging needs or shortcomings in existing content.

Impact + Metrics

-   As of May 2023, the COVID-19 Info Hub has been visited more than 106 million times. The site has been updated or enhanced more than 134,000 times.

-   The COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment Finder, which was created in response to user demand, has been visited nearly 6 million times.

Status

-   The COVID-19 Info Hub continues to be regularly updated with latest news and information about the virus, vaccines, and State assistance programs. 

-   Building on the success of the COVID-19 Info Hub, OOI is adapting the same model of data- and user-driven content delivery to create information hubs that address specific needs or communities including low-income college students, transgender residents, individuals with disabilities, and more.

COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment Finder
===================================

The COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment Finder helps users find and book open vaccine appointments nearest them. The tool compiles information in an easily searchable format from over a thousand vaccination sites run by the State, local health departments, pharmacies, and other health providers.

Challenge: During the initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines there was little information about where vaccines were available and how to make an appointment. Residents eager to get vaccinated resorted to calling pharmacies, doctors, and other health care providers, resulting in long phone wait times, overwhelmed health care workers, and delays in getting vaccinated.

Innovation In Action: OOI saw the opportunity to streamline a confusing and time-intensive process by building an online tool that addressed one of the greatest challenges to finding a vaccine appointment. Using an agile, iterative development process, OOI worked with the NJ Department of Health to launch a basic tool within weeks and then continued to refine and improve it based on user testing and comments rather than spending months to launch a "perfect" product.

Impact + Metrics

-   Created a comprehensive list to locate open vaccine appointments in New Jersey, eliminating the need to spend hours on the phone calling multiple locations. 

-   In 2021, the Appointment Finder was viewed over 5 million times. By December 15, 2021, one year after the start of the State's vaccination effort, more than 7 million New Jerseyans had received at least one dose, more than six million were fully vaccinated, and 1.6 million had gotten their booster shots.

Status

-   The appointment finder continues to be updated as needed with additional vaccine types, boosters, and more.

COVID-19 Symptom Checker
========================

The [COVID-19 Symptom Checker](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/self) was an interactive online tool that provided medical guidance to New Jerseyans about the virus during the earliest days of the pandemic. Using anonymous data, the tool also provided State officials with a way to track the disease's spread on the ground when few other means existed.

Challenge: Due to the extremely limited availability of testing at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, State officials had little sense of how quickly the virus was spreading and where, making it difficult to allocate scarce medical resources and personnel. At the same time, residents had little information about how COVID-19 spread, its symptoms, and what to do if they got sick. As a result, the State's call centers were overwhelmed with people asking similar health questions.

Innovation In Action: Drawing inspiration from other governments around the world that had developed similar tools, the Office of Innovation quickly built a prototype of the symptom checker. Working with a leading mathematician, OOI was able to incorporate the anonymous zip-code level data into several models to track and predict the spread of COVID-19 in great detail.

Impact + Metrics

-   Just 15 days after the first reported case of COVID-19 in the Garden State, OOI officially launched the State's COVID-19 symptom checker, giving residents personalized medical guidance and easing the strain on the State's call centers. 

-   By late April, 2022, approximately 200,000 people in New Jersey, or roughly 2% of the entire state, had used the symptom checker. This usage generated data that offered officials a wealth of granular, ZIP-code-level data at a time when information was scarce. By February 2021, the symptom checker had been used over 600,000 times.

-   Each day, data from the symptom checker was translated into plain-language reports and distributed to senior State officials to help them decide where to deploy ventilators, PPE stockpiles and other critical resources to save lives.

Status

-   With the widespread availability of testing and other disease monitoring tools, the Symptom Checker is no longer actively in use.

COVID-19 Jobs and Hiring Portal
===============================

The COVID-19 Jobs and Hiring portal was an online jobs board that connected short-staffed employers in select industries with workers who had lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To ensure high-quality listings, each post was vetted to ensure employers were permitted to operate during pandemic-related closures and what safety measures they were taking to protect workers.

Challenge: In March of 2020, hundreds of thousands of New Jersey workers suddenly found themselves without jobs as the pandemic ground the economy to a halt. Meanwhile, the businesses that remained open were left desperately short of employees as many residents were forced to stay home to care for children or loved ones amid school closures. The rapid policy developments and pandemic-related closures left many uncertain about where they could find reliable work and hesitant to use existing job listing sites - this created a tremendous imbalance in the labor market.

Innovation In Action: To help struggling New Jerseyans and businesses, the NJ Economic Development Authority (EDA) collaborated with the Office of Innovation to build a portal that relied on people's trust in the government to connect them to vetted jobs. Within five days, OOI had built and launched the jobs portal. The team deliberately kept the site's design simple both for ease of use and rapid development. Initially, the site was a list of employers with job openings, and for ease of access, neither job seekers nor employers needed to create accounts. Using an iterative approach, additional features were gradually added. But the priority was on releasing a usable product to immediately begin helping New Jersey's workers.

Impact + Metrics

-   When the portal launched, 8,000 jobs were posted. Another 4,000 were added by the second day. Eventually, 57,000 jobs appeared on the site from more than 1,200 employers.

-   In its first week, the portal was used by more than 150,000 people. Throughout its lifespan, the Jobs Portal attracted more than 960,000 users.

-   The COVID-19 Jobs Portal served as a model for the nation with several states re-using the design and structure of New Jersey's site; one state even used the source code.

Status

-   The COVID-19 Jobs Portal is no longer in use as the pandemic has evolved and the State's economy re-opened.

Statewide Update Email Program
==============================

The Statewide Update is an email newsletter program created at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to help broaden awareness of key policy updates, programs, and information that affect residents.\
Challenge: As COVID-19 emerged, governments were forced to rapidly adapt policies as the virus spread and new needs developed. With information and policies changing so quickly, many residents became confused and misinformation became rampant. In addition to press conferences and social media, the State needed additional ways to reach residents with official updates proactively.

Innovation In Action: To provide the State with another way to proactively communicate with residents, OOI worked with agencies to rapidly build an audience for a newsletter by both leveraging significant site traffic to COVID-19.NJ.gov, and by using pre-existing email lists. To ensure the newsletter was as effective as possible, content was written in plain language with a focus on actionable steps. The newsletter also used frequent A/B testing to improve messaging, layout, design, and more. Search data and website traffic data, as well as the Administration's policy priorities, informed what information, programs, and services were highlighted.

Impact + Metrics

-   As of August, 2023, with more than 2.1 million subscribers, the Statewide Update reaches nearly a quarter of New Jersey's population. 

-   To help overcome vaccine hesitancy, the Statewide Update sent 8 carefully crafted messages designed to address concerns. These emails resulted in 18.7 million opens, driving more than 132,000 visits to the Vaccine Appointment Finder as well as more than 200,000 additional visits to the COVID-19 Information Hub.

Status

-   As the pandemic has evolved, the newsletter has shifted from weekly updates about safety measures and COVID-relief programs to a biweekly newsletter highlighting programs and projects that might otherwise be underutilized.

Healthcare Professional "Call to Serve" Portal
==============================================

The Volunteer Medical Professionals Intake Form was an online portal that collected information from health care workers from around the country who wanted to help New Jersey battle COVID-19.

Challenge: Amid the first surge of COVID-19 in April 2020, Governor Murphy issued a nationwide call for volunteers and healthcare workers with medical experience to help New Jersey care for its sick. Many hospitals had reached capacity, healthcare workers were stretched thin, and the State was building several field hospitals to handle the massive influx of patients with COVID-19.

Innovation In Action: OOI quickly set up a simple online form at covid19.nj.gov/vounteer to automatically collect information and process volunteers as they stepped forward. The system allowed applications to be reviewed by NJ Department of Health officials for consideration of temporary credentialing. By automating and centralizing the process, agencies saved valuable time and resources as they battled the pandemic.

Impact + Metrics

-   The portal attracted offers to assist from more than 27,000 medical professionals and volunteers

Status

-   This tool is no longer actively in use as the pandemic has reached a new phase with widespread vaccination and medical capacity has remained at manageable levels.

Personal Protective and Medical Equipment Intake Form
=====================================================

[The PPE Intake Form](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/ppereport) is an online form for organizations in New Jersey to report personal protective equipment (PPE) levels and to donate equipment.

Challenge: In response to a severe shortage of PPE at the onset of the pandemic, Governor Murphy centralized efforts to acquire and distribute the critically needed equipment to protect health care workers from COVID-19. An Executive Order required all businesses, higher learning institutions, and non-hospital health care facilities to report any PPE in their possession. In addition, the Governor issued a call for donations to supplement the State's efforts to procure millions of pieces of PPE.

Innovation In Action: OOI rapidly built [covid19.nj.gov/ppereport](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/ppereport), a portal for organizations to report PPE levels and submit offers to donate needed equipment and supplies. By automating the process, the form enabled agencies to quickly accept and organize vast amounts of critical information with minimal time and effort. The portal also served as a centralized clearinghouse for these efforts as multiple agencies were receiving donation requests and lacked a formal mechanism to share this information.

Impact + Metrics

-   The Personal Protective and Medical Equipment Intake Form facilitated the collection of more than 600 donation offers.

Status

-   The reporting form remains active, though the shortage of PPE has been addressed.

========================================

Through the [Executive Order (EO) Violation Reporting Form](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/violation), users can report any organizations or individuals endangering public health and safety by not following emergency COVID-related executive orders issued by Governor Murphy.

Challenge: To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ease the strain on hospitals in the early stages of the pandemic, Governor Murphy issued several Executive Orders requiring health and safety measures at essential businesses, limits on gatherings, indoor mask requirements, the closure of non-essential businesses, and other protections. Unfortunately, some establishments did not follow these safety measures even after being warned and continued to jeopardize public health and safety.

Innovation In Action: To reduce the strain on the State's call centers, OOI created an online tool to streamline the reporting process. Online submissions were then shared with the Office of Emergency Management and the Office of the Attorney General to follow up.

Impact + Metrics

-   Using the tool, residents have reported more than 65,000 EO violations.

Status

-   The reporting form remains active, however many of the COVID-related Executive Orders have been rescinded as part of the State's reopening.

Out of State Traveler Registration Form
=======================================

The [Out of State Traveler Registration Form ](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/njtravel)was a voluntary online questionnaire that individuals filled out upon entering New Jersey to comply with the State's quarantine for incoming travelers from areas with heavy COVID-19 spread.

Challenge: To prevent the further spread of COVID-19, in June of 2020, Governor Murphy, along with the governors of New York and Connecticut, [announced ](https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20200624a.shtml)a travel advisory urging all individuals traveling from states with significant COVID-19 cases to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.

Innovation In Action: To help enforce the travel advisory, OOI developed an online form, accessible by email, text, or QR code, to centralize and organize the collection of information from thousands of individuals. That information was securely shared with the NJ Department of Health and the relevant local health department, which followed up with travelers regarding the quarantine.

Impact + Metrics

-   While the travel advisory was in effect, the [Travel Quarantine Form](https://covid19.nj.gov/njtravel) enabled the State to efficiently collect more than 157,000 traveler registrations.

Status

-   On May 17, 2021, Governor Murphy lifted the State's travel advisory and the form is no longer active.

As part of a statewide investigation into potential misconduct at nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals can report illegal activity or other misconduct to the NJ Attorney General's Office using the [Nursing Home Misconduct Reporting Form](https://covid19.nj.gov/ltc).

Challenge: Like the rest of the country, nursing homes and long-term care facilities in New Jersey were decimated by COVID-19, accounting for a disproportionately high number of deaths. To determine if any laws were broken or if entities should face penalties for their actions, the NJ Attorney General's Office opened a statewide investigation and called upon individuals to share information.

Innovation In Action: OOI created an online form for the NJ Attorney General's Office that allowed individuals to submit photos, documents, and other evidence of wrongdoing. Users were able to submit information anonymously or could choose to identify themselves to help further the investigation.

The [COVID-19 Eviction Protection Tool ](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/renter)helps prevent low-income New Jerseyans from being evicted if they suffered economic hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online self-certification tool helps users understand the protections they are eligible for and submit the necessary forms.

Challenge: In preparation for the end of the State's eviction moratorium, New Jersey introduced protections for low-income renters who struggled during the pandemic. Those who qualify can submit a self-certification form to their landlords, and for those with pending legal actions against them can submit the form to NJ Courts.

Innovation In Action: To ensure residents in need could stay in their homes, OOI created an easy-to-use online form that makes the process as seamless as possible. The interactive tool guides users through the process with a series of questions, automatically generates their self-certification form, and with back-end data sharing, users only need to fill out their information once and can share it with all relevant agencies.

NJ Eviction Moratorium Information + Question Form
==================================================

The NJ Eviction Moratorium Information + Question Form was an interactive form that helped renters and homeowners determine what protections were available to them during the pandemic.

Challenge: As the pandemic ground the economy to a halt in March 2020, more than 800,000 New Jersey workers suddenly found themselves without jobs or a way to pay their rent. The threat of eviction loomed over hundreds of thousands of households, and policymakers feared a homelessness crisis on an unprecedented scale.

Innovation in Action: The Office created an online tool that helped prevent low-income New Jerseyans from being evicted if they suffered economic hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic by learning their rights and discovering relevant rules and regulations. A resident could input information about their specific situation, and the interactive form provided information tailored to the resident's specific situation. It also allowed users to submit questions to DCA about their specific situations in a streamlined manner.

Impact + Metrics

The Business Experience Initiative
==================================

The Business Experience initiative is a cross-agency effort - launched as part of the Governor's 2018 Stronger and Fair Economic Plan - to make it easier to start, operate, and grow a business in New Jersey. To streamline a fragmented process and deliver a simplified, one-stop digital experience for businesses, OOI has launched several tools including [Business.NJ.gov](https://business.nj.gov/), the Business.NJ.gov [Navigator](https://navigator.business.nj.gov/), Business.NJ.gov [Live Chat](https://business.nj.gov/#), and Business.NJ.gov Updates.

Challenge: Prior to Business.NJ.Gov, to start and operate a business in the Garden State, companies and aspiring entrepreneurs had to navigate a byzantine process, sifting through 15 State websites to find information and creating multiple accounts to file forms and regulatory filings. OOI was tasked with streamlining these processes, and began consolidating dozens of related processes spread across multiple agencies into a single, easy-to-use platform for businesses.

Innovation In Action: Rather than waiting to debut a large-scale solution after a multi-year development process, OOI used agile and iterative development to quickly launch a series of tools that provided immediate value to users and offered critical data that informed further development. By using this agile process, results were both faster and more effective as each stage of development was built with a data-backed understanding of the business community's needs.

Impact + Metrics

-   With [Business.NJ.gov](https://business.nj.gov/), companies can now easily find the answer to any question they have, file critical forms, and get personalized recommendations -- all in one convenient place. 

-   Through the Business.NJ.gov [Navigator](https://navigator.business.nj.gov/), aspiring entrepreneurs can now develop personalized guides to starting their business, register their business and track their applications, find relevant funding opportunities, and get a personalized tax calendar. 

-   Businesses no longer need to repeatedly provide the same information as OOI enabled data-sharing between agencies for the first time. 

-   Businesses can access a centralized customer service experience in real time using the Business.NJ.Gov [live chat](https://business.nj.gov/#) - this allows businesses to get answers from experts and customer service representatives from multiple State agencies, alleviating the need to call several agencies.

Business.NJ.Gov
===============

[Business.NJ.Gov](https://business.nj.gov/) is a "first-stop" website with all the information businesses need to start, operate, and grow in New Jersey. Developed as part of the Business Experience Initiative, the site features a comprehensive range of content on everything from regulations to funding opportunities, hiring procedures to licensing, and more.

Challenge: Prior to Business.NJ.gov, information that businesses needed was organized by government agency rather than by use-case. This forced business owners to dig through more than 15 State websites to find the specific information they were seeking.

Innovation In Action: To modernize how businesses interact with the State, OOI has employed a data-informed, user-first design philosophy. In practice, that means OOI has focused on streamlining a fragmented system by organizing information and processes around how businesses actually use them rather than keeping related processes siloed within each State agency or department. Continuous and deliberate engagement with the end users -- New Jersey businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs -- is a key part of the process.

Impact + Metrics

-   Rather than sifting through multiple websites, companies can now easily find the answer to any question they have, file critical forms, and get personalized recommendations -- all in one convenient place.

-   In 2022, more than 850,000 people used Business.NJ.gov to get the information they needed.

In addition, users can file several required forms and complete a growing number of transactions all through the tool.

Challenge: Starting and operating a business in New Jersey requires navigating a complicated and fragmented process, bouncing from agency to agency, filing forms, providing redundant information, and creating multiple accounts. Prior to the Navigator, there was not a digital tool that allowed businesses to discover what they needed to complete, and how they could go about doing it.

Innovation In Action: With the user at the heart of every decision, OOI has transformed how businesses interact with New Jersey State government with a focus on ease and convenience. That means serving up all the information businesses need in a digestible, actionable format rather than placing the burden on businesses to search across multiple agencies. It also means streamlining policies and enabling data-sharing across agencies, so businesses can complete transactions without needing several accounts and individual forms from different agencies.  

Impact + Metrics

-   Entrepreneurs now have personalized Starter Kits specific to over 50 industries for starting their companies in New Jersey. This guide explains what forms and licenses they need, legal requirements, and more. 

-   Through advanced data-sharing, any new company can now legally form their business and check their license application status directly through the Navigator rather than by visiting multiple agencies. 

-   For the first time, businesses now have a personalized calendar for deadlines and filings, as well as personalized funding and certification recommendations from a growing statewide database.

Challenge: Multiple State departments and agencies are responsible for administering critical business transactions. Prior to the Live Chat, when a business had a question or needed help, they had to call multiple State agencies with long wait times before getting answers -- a process many found difficult and frustrating.

Innovation In Action: OOI partnered with the Business Action Center and other departments to centralize a fragmented customer service experience, cutting red tape by directly connecting businesses to relevant customer support. The service does not just improve the experience for business customers; by reducing call volume the Live Chat enables agency staff to serve more residents with greater efficiency.

Business.NJ.Gov Updates
-----------------------

Business.NJ.gov Updates is an email update program that proactively shares information on new programs, services, and regulatory changes for businesses and nonprofits operating in New Jersey.

Challenge: The rapid creation of emergency aid programs, new safety requirements, and other critical developments during the pandemic underscored the need for additional ways to keep businesses in New Jersey up to date with the latest news. Traditional media outlets and social media offered limited reach when it comes to news that specifically affect businesses, so many business owners miss out on important information and opportunities.

Innovation: To provide the State with a means to more effectively proactively reach businesses, OOI launched an email update program to inform businesses about regulations and news. The newsletter uses plain-language and focuses on actionable news and information. Through the continuous analysis of data analytics and periodic engagement with users, OOI improves communication and service delivery.

Emergency Assistance Eligibility Wizard
=======================================

The [Emergency Assistance Eligibility Wizard](https://assistance.business.nj.gov/) is an online tool that helped New Jersey businesses find and apply for newly created State and federal pandemic relief programs.

Challenge: The COVID-19 pandemic presented significant financial challenges to most companies and nonprofits across the Garden State. To help these organizations survive, the State and federal government launched numerous emergency assistance programs - each of which had different eligibility requirements and benefits. There was no centralized way to quickly determine which programs could help a specific business or organization.

Innovation In Action: To make it easy for organizations to understand which support programs are available to them and encourage uptake, OOI created an online tool that automatically checked their eligibility for nearly 20 programs. By answering a few simple questions, users receive a personalized list of all the programs they are eligible for and how to apply for them. In order to ensure that the tool met the needs of businesses, the tool was created in partnership with businesses that provided feedback on the design and content.

Impact + Metrics

-   The Emergency Assistance Eligibility Wizard has been used more than 210,000 times by more than 140,000 users.

Status

-   The tool is no longer actively in use as many of the emergency relief programs have sunsetted. The Business.NJ.gov Navigator now provides much of this tool's functionality.

Innovation Skills Accelerator
=============================

The [New Jersey Innovation Skills Accelerator](https://skills.innovation.nj.gov/) is a free, online learning program that trains public officials to think differently and serve residents more effectively by using data, new technologies, and innovative methods. The program - which consists of at-your-own pace and live trainings -  covers a range of modern methodologies like user-centered design, agile approaches, and evidence-based decision making.

Challenge: Public sector professionals in government are responsible for tackling critical challenges, but often lack the tools, strategies, and resources to better serve residents. At the same time, the public sector is underserved in training and upskilling opportunities, especially in modern practices related to the use of technology, design, and data. OOI needed to identify ways to help strengthen the capacity of public sector professionals to solve public challenges.

Innovation In Action: To reduce barriers and ensure the greatest spread of knowledge, OOI created a free, online training course that anyone can complete at their own pace. Each learning module connects users with top talent in a range of fields from New Jersey and beyond through video instruction, interviews, readings, and self-assessments. These modules are complemented by in-person bootcamps and workshops as well as bespoke programming developed to meet the needs of agency partners.

Impact + Metrics

-   The Innovation Skills Accelerator's online content is publicly accessible for free, so officials at every level of government across New Jersey and beyond can learn how to be more innovative.

-   In 2022, over 1,300 State employees signed up for 12 live, virtual workshops on innovation skills to help them use data, collective intelligence, and human-centered design to better serve New Jersey residents

-   As part of the Innovation Skills Accelerator program, OOI developed bespoke innovation skills programming with the New Jersey Attorney General's Office that included introductions to machine learning, predictive analytics, and collective intelligence with the aim of exploring how these technologies can be used to create more effective policies and services.

Status

-   As of the Spring of 2023, the Innovation Skills Accelerator team is working with the newly-formed interstate training collaborative, InnovateUS -- created in partnership with California, Colorado, Maine and Pennsylvania -- to launch a fully-redeveloped course on digital skills and problem solving. 

-   The Accelerator program, in partnership with InnovateUS, continues to deliver live and bespoke trainings for State departments.

SmarterNJ
=========

SmarterNJ is an initiative designed to improve the quality of government policies, programs, and services by fostering meaningful engagement with residents, businesses, and non-government organizations. Working in partnership with State departments and agencies, SmarterNJ works to harness the insights, perspective, and passion of the public to improve government outcomes.

Challenge: Government policy making and service delivery can often be disconnected from the very individuals it is designed to help. To make policies even more effective, the State must tap its most valuable assets: the intelligence, expertise, and know-how of its people. However, engaging with residents in meaningful ways, and at scale, has long been a challenge for government.

Innovation In Action: SmarterNJ leverages technology, modern approaches, and industry expertise to tap the public to solve problems, develop policies, and measure the impacts of services. OOI's approach is guided by a fundamentally different philosophy: one that seeks to open design, development, and implementation processes to those outside of government. SmarterNJ's tools include: open innovation, crowdsourcing, participatory research and evaluation, prize-backed challenges, and more.

Impact + Metrics:

-   SmarterNJ launched the Innovation ENJINE Challenge, an open call to State employees for proposals to make government more effective and efficient. Over 2,000 employees participated, and the five winning proposals were selected in late 2019. OOI  worked with those teams to help implement their plans. One notable proposal has already been implemented on the NJ Department of Labor's site, reducing long phone wait times. 

-   Your Future of Work, a problem identification consultation, was launched in partnership with the New Jersey Future of Work Task Force. The project engaged over 4,000 workers to better understand the ways in which a changing economy and technology were impacting their jobs. 

-   To support New Jersey's efforts to combat COVID-19, the [Your Voice Your Shot](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/yourvoice) video contest asked the community to create compelling videos encouraging vaccination. [Watch the winning video here](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/yourvoice).

Innovation ENJINE Challenge
===========================

The Innovation ENJINE Challenge was an open innovation challenge launched in the Spring of 2019 - it sourced ideas from State government employees to make government more effective and efficient, and then elicited proposed implementation plans from teams of State employees to bring select proposed innovations to life. This work was executed as part of the SmarterNJ Initiative.

Challenge: State departments and agencies offer thousands of programs and services, and while tens of thousands of State government employees participate in the delivery of those programs services, most are not empowered to improve them. Yet, State employees have one of the best perspectives of the challenges the State faces, and the knowledge, expertise, and insights needed to solve those challenges.

Innovation In Action: The Innovation ENJINE Challenge focused on eliciting novel solutions to challenges in the New Jersey State government. ENJINE was designed as a two-stage challenge. In stage one, employees submitted their ideas and voted on one another's submissions. The twenty most impactful and implementable short proposals advanced. In stage two, individuals and teams crafted plans to implement one of those twenty ideas. A panel of expert judges selected winning teams, which received expert support to advance potential implementation.

Impact + Metrics:

-   Over 2,000 employees participated, and the five winning proposals were selected in late 2019. OOI provided coaching to teams to implement their plans, however, the pandemic required to coaching program to be cut short.

-   One proposal, a [user-friendly chatbot](https://www.nj.gov/labor/lwdhome/press/2020/20200511_chatbot.shtml) that answers common unemployment-related questions, was implemented on the NJ Department of Labor's site, reducing long phone wait times and in-person appointments so users can get help immediately.

Your Future of Work
===================

Your Future of Work was a problem identification consultation in partnership with the NJ Future of Work Task Force. The project engaged New Jersey's workers to better understand the ways in which a changing economy and technology were impacting their jobs. This work was executed as part of the SmarterNJ Initiative.

Challenge: As part of the Future of Work Task Force's efforts to determine how technology was changing New Jersey's economy and how to prepare the state for those shifts, the Task Force needed to understand how workers perceived the impact of new technology, including their concerns and their hopes.

Innovation In Action: Over three weeks in early 2020, the New Jersey Future of Work Task Force, with the help of 40 advocacy and interest groups around the state, asked New Jersey's workers and employees to share their greatest concerns with regard to the impact of new technology on three policy areas: lifelong learning and skills, rights and benefits for workers, and workplace health and safety. Using a digital tool, the project team was able to quickly engage thousands of New Jersey workers. This engagement leveraged a platform, called All Our Ideas, that allows survey designers to present a seemingly simple choice between two options, but behind the scenes, a powerful algorithm analyzes these individual responses to produce insights that allow for the comparison of hundreds of choices.

Impact + Metrics

-   In just three weeks, the project team was able to hear directly from over 4,000 workers and gain critical insights that helped the State create new programs to help them.

Status

-   The project concluded in February of 2020 and its findings informed the Future of Work Task Force's final report and recommendations.\

Your Voice, Your Shot Video Contest
===================================

[Your Voice, Your Shot](https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/yourvoice), a citizen engagement campaign, was a video contest to support the State's efforts to combat COVID-19. New Jerseyans submitted videos sharing their reasons for getting vaccinated and encouraged others to do the same. The winning video, chosen by the public, was used in New Jersey's COVID-19 public health campaign. This work was executed as part of the SmarterNJ Initiative.

Challenge: As COVID-19 vaccines were becoming widely available to most Americans, many people -- particularly those in vulnerable communities -- remained hesitant to get vaccinated, and vaccinating the vast majority of New Jerseyans was critical to saving millions of lives. The State needed creative solutions to encourage members of the public to get vaccinated.

Innovation In Action: Research has shown that some of the most effective messengers to win over the vaccine hesitant were local community members. So as an alternative to top-down communications, OOI empowered residents to share their own messages with others on social media using #YourVoiceYourShotNJ and fostered a sense of shared responsibility by crowdsourcing and voting on videos.

Impact + Metrics

-   The contest received 29 video entries, 3 finalists were selected, and more than 1,955 New Jerseyans voted for their favorite. The winning video was featured in a paid social media campaign that reached over 220,000 individuals generating more than 1 million impressions.

Unemployment Insurance Application Redesign
===========================================

OOI helped modernize the NJ Department of Labor's [Unemployment Insurance application](https://www.myunemployment.nj.gov/before/about/howtoapply/applyonline.shtml), making it easier for New Jerseyans to apply for unemployment benefits and streamlining back-end processes. The legacy weekly certification site has been replaced with a new, simplified site that allows workers to apply for benefits from their phones. This ongoing work is part of the Resident Experience initiative.

Challenge: As the pandemic upended lives and the economy, hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans were suddenly left unemployed. The unprecedented flood of applications to the State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) system significantly strained an outdated system that had been underinvested in for decades. Complicated application language and complex State and Federal requirements compounded the challenge of a massive increase in application volume. Residents were frustrated by delays and confused by the process, while State employees struggled to administer an inefficient and outdated system.

Innovation In Action: Using a resident-first design approach, OOI worked with the NJ Department of Labor and other partners to launch a new initial claim application. As part of this process, project partners interviewed applicants to understand which application questions were misunderstood, leading to delays in receiving benefits. Working with state and federal partners, OOI tested a series of changes with users including simplified, plain-language questions, bigger text and answer buttons, and the addition of clarifying text. Updates also included ensuring the application is mobile-friendly and meets accessibility design standards. This work also spurred the creation of a new Office of UI Modernization at NJDOL to oversee ongoing and future efforts.

Impact + Metrics

-   Unemployment insurance certification success rates have risen from approximately 63% to 88%, while the average time to complete an application has fallen by 48 minutes.

Status

-   The UI application system continues to be updated using agile software development, which continually introduces improvements.

Benefits Eligibility Tool
=========================

The [Benefits Eligibility Tool](https://getstarted.nj.gov/labor/) was an online tool that made it easier for New Jersey workers affected by the pandemic to apply for newly created unemployment benefit programs and services. By answering a few simple questions, users received a personalized list of all the programs they were eligible for in priority order.

Challenge: New Jersey's unemployment rate more than quadrupled from March 2020 to April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of families were left struggling to meet basic needs. In response to this unprecedented challenge, the State and federal governments created new laws, programs, and benefits to help. But many residents were unfamiliar with these programs and uncertain which was right for them.

Innovation In Action: To help people navigate the new landscape of programs and ensure they received the maximum amount of benefits possible, OOI built a tool to preliminarily check a user's eligibility for nearly 20 programs based on their answers to a series of simple questions. The tool then provided the user with next steps for how to apply for those benefits. Development of the tool was informed by interviews with potential users, and as a result, the tool covered an array of scenarios including whether a worker was laid-off, self-employed, caring for a sick family member, or tending to their children during a school closure.

Impact + Metrics

-   The eligibility tool was used more than 80,000 times, connecting residents with critical programs and services and increasing their chances of applying for the right programs and getting the maximum amount of benefits allowed. 

-   With an online tool available, users were less likely to call the NJ Department of Labor to inquire about their eligibility for programs - this diverted calls from over-burdnend call centers, allowing call center representatives with more time to focus on complicated cases.

Status

-   The tool was updated several times during the pandemic as new federal, state, and local benefits became available. Many of the programs have sunsetted as the pandemic has evolved, so the tool is no longer actively in use.

Future of Work Task Force
=========================

The Future of Work Task Force was formed in 2018 to study how technological advancements will impact New Jersey's economy and workforce, and to produce a comprehensive policy roadmap to prepare and protect New Jerseyans from disruptive changes. The Task Force issued its policy roadmap and recommendations in early 2022.

Challenge: The Task Force was charged with determining which technologies will reshape work in New Jersey, identifying which industries and communities will be affected, and exploring how technology can improve workplace conditions, create different jobs, and grow the State's economy. Lastly, the Task Force was asked to devise strategies that State government, private sector, and nonprofits can employ to prepare for these changes.

Innovation In Action: Chaired by New Jersey's Chief Innovation Officer, Beth Simone Noveck, the Task Force assembled a diverse body of experts not just to study the problem, but to act. So in addition to providing recommendations, the Task Force simultaneously helped implement several key initiatives to build opportunities for workers in New Jersey.

Impact + Metrics

-   In early 2022, the Task force [delivered ](https://fowtf.innovation.nj.gov/resources.html)its policy roadmap with 19 core recommendations that underscore the State's need to invest in policies, platforms, and programs that respond to both the challenges and the opportunities technology creates to foster worker rights, worker safety and lifelong learning. 

-   Many of the Roadmap's recommendations have already been implemented including the launch of the [Future of Work Accelerator](https://accelerator.fow.nj.gov/), a 9-month program that supports innovations to advance workers' health and safety, improve access to benefits, and strengthen training opportunities in New Jersey.

Lifelong Learning Accounts
==========================

Lifelong Learning Accounts (LiLA) is one of the nation's first pilot programs that will provide residents with unrestricted funds to be used for job training, education, career coaching, job search assistance, and wraparound services such as childcare, eldercare, transportation to training, and more. The pilot program stems from the New Jersey State Future of Work Task Force.

Challenge: Disruptive new technologies are changing the economy, eliminating the need for some jobs while creating new ones altogether. To adapt, workers need new skills, which requires training and education. Research from the [Future of Work Task Force](https://fowtf.innovation.nj.gov/resources.html) found that many workers lack access to training, and many employers do not provide or fund significant training opportunities. Workers also face additional barriers to accessing training, such as limited financial resources to pay for child or eldercare that would be required for them to participate in upskilling or training programs outside of work.

Innovation In Action: Unlike many assistance programs, Lifelong Learning Accounts enable residents to focus resources on overcoming the barriers specific to their lives. Research has shown that allowing individuals to manage spending decisions, rather than the government, creates the greatest impact. Residents in need of up-skilling later in their careers are more likely to have families and other financial obligations and time commitments that make training more difficult. By allowing residents to use funds for wrap-around services like childcare, LiLA enables a broader pool of the workforce to engage in up-skilling.

Impact + Metrics

-   Governor Murphy and the Legislature have set aside $10 million to create this first-of-its-kind Lifelong Learning Account pilot for qualifying New Jerseyans who are long-term unemployed or employed residents that qualify as Asset Limited Income Constrained.

Future of Work Accelerator
==========================

The Future of Work Accelerator was a 9-month program that advanced innovations aimed at enhancing the lives of New Jersey's workers by improving health and safety, increasing access to benefits, strengthening training opportunities, and bolstering worker voice. The program brought together local and national innovators, providing them with coaching, masterclasses, and access to funders to help develop and scale innovations in the Garden State.

Challenge: New Jersey's Future of Work Task Force identified key ways in which technology might impact the lives and livelihoods of New Jerseyans. At the same time, the Task Force recognized that the breadth of impact required participation from non-governmental actors to contribute to solving challenges arising from changes in technology. To address these impacts, the State needed to identify and accelerate the development of solutions to help workers.

Innovation In Action: To address such a broad challenge, there was a need to encourage innovative solutions beyond government -- and across industries and disciplines -- to support workers. In addition to providing innovators with workshops, mentoring, and connections to funders and potential State partners/resources, the Future of Work Accelerator also created a community of social entrepreneurs dedicated to helping residents. The FOW Accelerator was made possible through philanthropic funding.

Future of Work Policy + Practice Catalog
========================================

The Future of Work [Policy & Practice Catalog ](https://fow.innovation.nj.gov/)-- developed as a tool for the Future of Work Task Force -- aggregated leading research, policies, and practices on how to respond to the challenges and opportunities created by the impact of new technology on work. The searchable database collected research so Future of Work Task Force members and other decisions-makers could easily view ideas from numerous studies in a single, easy to use format.

Challenge: The Future of Work Task Force needed a mechanism to review relevant research, policies, and approaches related to the future of work, and evaluate approaches to create a more resilient workforce and spur the creation of good jobs. Every year new research is produced on the topic, and this growing body of work is scattered across reports, articles, and studies, making it difficult for policy makers to stay up to date and make use of this knowledge.

Innovation In Action: OOI partnered with academia to review dozens of reports, articles, and policies related to the future of work and compiled that information into a searchable and sortable format. The catalog was made publicly accessible so that other policy-makers and researchers -- in addition to FOW Task Force members -- could quickly access material relevant to their communities and interests, including concrete responses to technological advancement for use by government, companies, educational institutions and unions. Each proposal includes a short description and examples where it has been implemented.

Algorithmic Hiring Education Initiative
=======================================

At the recommendation of the Future Of Work Task Force, OOI is exploring an education initiative about the risks of algorithmic hiring tools that can inadvertently introduce discrimination and limit diversity in hiring.

Challenge: In an effort to reduce individual biases, employers often rely on algorithms to help make hiring decisions, screen candidates, and even administer interviews. However, studies have found that these algorithms may actually reinforce existing biases, penalizing candidates who identify as women, people of color, or those with disabilities, as well as those who attended certain schools or dress in a certain way.

Innovation In Action: OOI has deployed a research-backed and multi-disciplinary approach to exploring this problem area, while also tapping outside experts and academia to deepen the State's understanding of the public policy challenges that algorithmic hiring tools present.

Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool
================================

The [Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool](http://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/timeline) helps expecting parents plan when and how to take their maternity leave by providing a personalized calendar of how much leave time they have with State benefits. This work is part of the Resident Experience Initiative.

Challenge: Most people who work in New Jersey qualify for paid leave benefits under Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance. However, to use these benefits, parents must navigate a complex application process, tracking multiple details and making calculations on their own, increasing the likelihood of making a mistake during the application process or delaying access to the benefit.

Innovation In Action: Working closely with community partners and expecting parents to understand their needs, OOI saw an opportunity to use technology to simplify a confusing aspect of family leave and reduce stress. After asking parents a series of questions, the tool automatically provides start and end dates for leave based on their specific circumstances and preferences, giving parents clarity about the benefits they can access and when.

Impact + Metrics

-   As of May 2023, 62,300 New Jerseyans have used the Maternity Coverage Timeline Tool to understand their benefits; and 54,690 timelines have been created (since launch of the tool in May 2022).

Training Explorer
=================

The Training Explorer is a tool that uses public sector data to help job seekers find the best training programs for their needs. Using the tool, residents can easily filter and compare more than 5,000 training programs from across New Jersey to make data-informed choices about their future.

Challenge: When it comes to training programs, there is no shortage of choice for those seeking to start a career, find a new one, or level up their skills. The prospect of spending hours poring through multiple sites to find the right one, and comparing the relative strengths of each program can be overwhelming. The lack of data about potential outcomes or consistency across programs makes these difficult decisions even harder.

Innovation In Action: Using open data, OOI collaborated with the New Jersey Department of Labor to create the first interactive, comprehensive list of all schools and organizations in New Jersey offering subsidized workforce training. With this data, OOI has empowered training seekers to use data and evidence to help choose a training program that's right for them. By standardizing metrics for over 5,000 programs, the Training Explorer provides residents with information like a clear cost breakdown for each program, projections for how much they can earn after finishing a program, information on the likelihood of getting a job, and more. With an understanding that no two training seekers are the same, users are able to filter which programs are wheelchair accessible, provide child care assistance, teach in different languages, or have evening classes.

Impact + Metrics

-   The Training Explorer was the first major update to the State's training portal in over two decades. Residents now have access to a comprehensive list of subsidized workforce trainings in a bilingual, searchable, and mobile-friendly interface. 

-   Residents no longer need to visit multiple websites to learn about NJ DOL-approved trainings, and now get personalized, data-backed recommendations.

Status

-   OOI is continuing to build additional features for the Training Explorer including more filters, multi-language support, and integration with related workforce tools.

NJ Career Central Hub
=====================

OOI is working with the NJ Department of Labor and other project partners to build the NJ Career Central Hub: a digital "front door" for all jobseekers that houses several new tools including an AI-powered guide that provides personalized career recommendations, a resource to organize job search activities into manageable steps, and a comprehensive, searchable list of all subsidized training programs. This work is now part of the Resident Experience initiative.

Challenge: Finding a job or changing careers is often a daunting task - it's stressful, confusing, and frustrating. Job seekers have a multiple resources that they can access in different ways and places, and there is no single "right career path." This challenge necessitates career support that's tailored to the individual and their needs, and to ensure that New Jersey residents have the tools and opportunities to succeed.

Innovation In Action: The NJ Career Central Hub provides personalized guides and data-drives recommendations for job seekers. Supported by AI and machine learning that analyzes 8 million wage records from individuals, NJ Career Central Hub guides users by providing insights into how transitions between industries and differences in degrees, certifications, and credentials can impact future wages. Users are provided with quality job listings, personalized job recommendations, workforce skills identification, and subsidized training opportunities when applicable.

Impact + Metrics

-   OOI is providing New Jersey workers with simple, straightforward ways to explore careers, training opportunities, and job openings in a range of industries.

Status

-   The NJ Career Central Hub soft launched in the Fall of 2022 and is undergoing user testing for further refinement including digital career coaching tools and multi-language support.

Communication + Engagement Lab
==============================

The Communication and Engagement Lab (C+E Lab) is an initiative that aims to modernize and enhance the State's ability to better connect New Jersey's residents and institutions to State programs, resources, and services through the use of data, research, and modern consumer marketing techniques.

Challenge: Government programs and services often lack adequate resources to reach audiences at scale. A lack of government capacity to deploy new tools, social and behavioral research, and data-driven insights means eligible residents often do not know about the programs and services intended to serve them.

Innovation In Action: The C+E Lab moves residents to take action by using proven consumer marketing techniques and data. Rather than relying on assumptions, the C+E Lab conducts research and leverages data to understand consumer motivations and then uses those learnings to craft strategies that meets consumers where they are and ultimately move them to action. This strategic approach differs from traditional government communications efforts as it is guided by research and focused on impact.

Impact + Metrics

-   The C+E Lab supported the successful launch and ongoing optimization of Business.NJ.gov's first paid media campaign. The campaign is increasing the user base of Business.NJ.gov and is providing learning around channels, tactics, and creative execution. The campaign is also enabling us to create an understanding on if our efforts are equitable in their reach.

-   The C+E Lab advised and supported OSHE to develop a paid media campaign designed to connect residents to the State's Some College, No Degree initiative. The campaign will launch in late August and create "leads", residents that indicate they are interested in learning more about the SCND initiative, that a State procured vendor will work to enroll.

-   The C+E Lab conducted research for State Library that identified a perception problem with residents who stopped visiting the Library in-person. Once residents became aware of the services the Library provides, it created intent to return. Library used our findings to develop a new campaign that is driving residents back into the Library again.

Status

-   The C+E Lab was launched in early 2022 and has conducted several engagements with State teams and agencies. In 2023, the Lab seeks to launch two high-impact marketing campaigns with its State partners.

OSHE Some College, No Degree Campaign
=====================================

The Office of Innovation is working with the NJ Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE) to launch a campaign encouraging New Jersey students, who started college, but left before finishing their degree, to return. This work is being undertaken by the C+E Lab.

Challenge: Roughly 1 million New Jerseyans have started college, but stopped before completing their degree. The State, led by OSHE, has launched a suite of financial assistance and coaching tools to help these individuals to return to school and earn their degree.

Innovation In Action: To help the OSHE project team persuade non-returning students to re-enroll in higher education, the C+E Lab is tasked with helping create a marketing campaign to drive awareness and uptake of these programs and services. The C+E lab conducted ethnographic research to understand the target audience's underlying motivations. This research then informed the creation of a communication strategy that will ultimately move these individuals to return to college and complete their degree.

Impact + Metrics: 

-   The C+E Lab's research shifted OSHE's understanding of their target audience, and revealed that the State's approach would not motivate students to return and could be potentially alienating. 

-   Based on its research, the Lab developed a communication strategy that reframed the State's narrative and recommended media channels and budgets to meet the audience where they are -- particularly underserved communities. 

-   Also based on its research, the Lab developed creative concepts that brought the communication strategy to life, and quantitatively validated the concepts as most effective in creating awareness and intent.

Status:

-   The C+E Lab is leading the development of creative assets that will support the launch of the SCND paid media campaign in late August. We will continue to provide advisory support to OSHE through the end of the SCND campaign in December.

Business.NJ.Gov Digital Marketing Beta Campaign
===============================================

The C+E Lab worked with the Business.NJ.gov team to launch and short-term digital marketing campaign to boost traffic to its site and gain initial learnings about marketing performance opportunities

Challenge: The Business.NJ.gov team relies on user testing and site data to inform their work. But web traffic on Business.NJ.gov had stagnated, hampering the development of new products and features due to an insufficient amount of incoming data. So the C+E Lab was tasked with increasing traffic to the site to accelerate learnings.

Innovation In Action: The C+E Lab developed a 6-week, multichannel campaign to increase site traffic and drive learnings. The Lab's comprehensive services included creative concept development, the creation of creative assets, multichannel planning, establishing a test and learn framework, and setting up a data dashboard to monitor the campaign in real time. Prior to the C+E Lab, the State would have needed to outsource these tasks to a marketing agency, but with the Lab, it now has those advanced capabilities in-house.

Impact + Metrics

-   The C+E Lab's campaign increased site traffic during +37% Year Over Year since launch, with 39% of the traffic consisting of audiences new to Business.NJ.gov.

Status

-   The C+E Lab is continuing to work with the Business.NJ.gov team to promote its tools and better understand its audience.

Transgender Information Hub
===========================

The [Transgender Information Hub](http://transgender.nj.gov) is a central resource for the transgender and non-binary community in New Jersey that provides guidance and answers to common questions. The site features critical information from nearly a dozen agencies in a supportive, user-friendly format.

Challenge: For transgender and non-binary New Jerseyans, basic actions like updating a name or gender marker on official documents can be unexpectedly challenging and potentially traumatizing. Antiquated policies required individuals to get medical documentation and navigate a complex web of local, state, and federal requirements. The Governor and the legislature passed new laws to remove these barriers and protect the privacy of transgender individuals, however outdated information continues to circulate online. Yet, without a central source of information, transgender and non-binary individuals still needed to sift through multiple state agencies and departments to obtain basic services. 

Innovation In Action: To ensure the needs of transgender and non-binary New Jerseyans were met, OOI used a data-driven and user-centered approach by first conducting a user-needs survey to understand the most pressing needs and concerns. OOI partnered with advocacy and service-based organizations throughout the state to both amplify the survey, and gain insights. Additionally, numerous user-testing sessions further informed the site's content and design. Rather than a static website, the Transgender Information Hub's design, organization, and content continues to be updated based on user data and feedback to better serve residents.

Impact + Metrics

-   For the first time, transgender New Jerseyans have a government resource dedicated to simplifying critical services and no longer need to spend hours visiting multiple sites.

Status

-   In early 2023, a beta version of the Transgender Information Hub was launched, and is currently undergoing user-testing and further refinement based on feedback.

Disabilities Information Hub
============================

New Jersey's Disabilities Information Hub will serve as a central source of information for individuals with disabilities and their families and caregivers. The site will consolidate critical information from dozens of agencies in a user-friendly format on a range of topics from health care to utility assistance, transportation to in-home support, and more.

Challenge: There are a multitude of state programs that support people with disabilities, however finding and accessing them can be a challenge as they are largely organized by the agency responsible for administering the program. In practice, that means poring over dozens of different state websites to find information which increases the likelihood that users may not get the information or help they need. 

Innovation In Action: Building on the model pioneered by the COVID-19 Information Hub, OOI is building the Disabilities Information Hub around specific user needs rather than organizing information by government agency. In addition, to ensure users' needs are fully met, OOI is employing an iterative, data-driven and human-centered approach. In practice, this means OOI first conducted a survey and worked with advocacy organizations to understand the most pressing needs and challenges of New Jerseyans with disabilities. Throughout the development process, the site's content and design will continually be revised based on user testing and feedback. Given the hub's intended audience, OOI is also working closely with accessibility experts to optimize the site's accessibility for all users. 

Impact + Metrics

-   When the Disabilities Hub launches, New Jerseyans with disabilities and their families and caregivers will no longer have to navigate a maze of state agencies and instead will have an easy to use, centralized portal for all their needs.

Status

-   As of March 2023, the Disabilities Hub is under development. A beta version will launch later this year.

The[ College Support Resource Hub](https://www.info.nj.gov/basicneeds) is a central source of information for college students in New Jersey who need support with meeting their basic needs. The site features easily-accessible, actionable information to help students with food, housing, childcare, transportation, and overcoming other barriers to continuing their pursuit of higher education.

Challenge: Many college students -- particularly low-income people of color -- struggle to meet their basic needs including getting enough to eat and even accessing adequate housing. This hampers academic performance and forces many to drop out. While there are programs available to help, they are scattered across multiple agency websites and students may not be aware of their ability to access these vital resources. 

Innovation In Action: Building on the model pioneered by the COVID-19 Information Hub, OOI built the College Support Resource Hub around the specific needs of college students rather than organizing information by government agency. To ensure users' needs are met, OOI used an iterative, data-first design philosophy that prioritized first understanding students' greatest needs. In addition, the hub's content, design, and organization will continue to be revised based on user testing and feedback.

Vaccine Hesitancy Email Campaign

Following the release of the first-ever COVID-19 vaccine, the Office of Innovation, in partnership with NJ Department of Health and numerous other partners, developed and implemented a statwide eight message email campaign designed to address vaccine hesitancy concerns.  

Challenge

Innovation In Action

-   The Office of Innovation worked with academic partners and public health experts to research key motivations that drove people's decision-making regarding whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This research was further informed by several A/B tests to validate and iterate on the campaign's proposed approaches. To increase the campaign's reach, OOI also coordinated across State departments and agencies to leverage pre-existing distribution channels to connect with a broader, more diverse audience.

Impact + Metrics

-   The vaccine hesitancy campaign reached 5.4 million New Jerseyans; a total of 41.8 million emails were sent, generating more than 18.7 million impressions

-   More 5 million subscribers stayed engaged throughout the campaign, with only 5% of the total the audience unsubscribing at any point.

-   The email campaign directly drove more than 132,000 visits to the State's Vaccine Appointment Finder, as well as more than 200,000 additional visits to the COVID-19 Information Hub

-   During the campaign timeline, 803,000 additional New Jerseyans became fully vaccinated

MISC NOTES

RIPL, DOL ORI and NJ Innovation have partnered to outfit NJDOL with tools to Expected outcomes include valid, non-spam, job listings, personalized job opportunity connections, workforce skills identification, and if applicable, subsidized training

-   Design and launch a common "front door" for NJ's job seeking digital services, by integrating the job seeking tools below in one platform that is intuitive and meets jobseeker's needs.

-   Launch a NJ Career Recommendation Engine, an AI/ML-driven tool that can be connected to UI, is intuitive and easy-to-use, and delivers actionable results.

-   Launch "NJ Career Central Hub", a resource to organize job search activities into manageable steps and learn skills to manage stress while finding employment.

-   Integrate "NJ Training Explorer", a comprehensive listing of all education and job training programs that are eligible to receive publicly funded tuition assistance with impact metrics.

-   Leverage the project's cloud infrastructure, the Research Data Lake ("RDL"), to gain real-time performance insights department-wide, automate business processes (e.g., UI reporting), and explore research topics.

How it works: The recommendation engine is powered by approximately 8 million wage records of individuals across an average of 20 quarters/individual provides insights into transitions between all industries in New Jersey and the impact of those transitions on wages. Linkage of resume data with wage records gives an understanding of the history and timing of degrees, certifications, and credentials earned by approx. 400K individuals. When combined with wage records, data on training providers (450+), programs (4,600+), and enrollment enable insights into the impact of training on wages.

Digital front door that lets people navigate whatever situation in their worker journey - high school or college student, or someone wanting to make career change, different digital offerings through front door that link to other NJDOL services - help them get through process quicker

central hub is managed by research org, which focuses on how data connected -- fearless developing it so it ties to more specific uses

-->one site to rule them all from across all the agencies/training opps -- AI driven recommendations made by RIPL - like Netflix algorithm for career training/opps based on what you've done --personalized recommendations, more than just a self-service platform - guiding folks for career changes and training

-->specific need that's missing - lots of services, but folks not clear

->central hub tries to solve for -- data piece - how people navigate different career changes, specifically unemployment lists to segment folks looking at career change

-nature of work changing and lots of long-term unemployed folks or helping folks to make data informed decisions (it's not just polling career counselors it's wage records, scraping resumes,etc. to provide recs for individuals)

--Success metric -- how measure success is still usage -- one thing to change is what the data is saying after adoption, how do we translate into dollars, jobs, economic impacts

-Can we beat what economy is doing -- what's impact of recs with these informed decisions -- are we beating market expectations

-->alleviating unemployment in the state

New Jersey Career Network ([NJCN](https://njcareers.org/)) is an initiative developed in partnership with the New Jersey Department of Labor and the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. NJCN is an intelligent platform that is backed by academic research, validation by expert coaches, and user research that builds job seekers' skills and confidence. NJCN guides job seekers through their day-to-day job search process in order to find a meaningful career by providing personalized structure, tools, resources, and access to interventions.

The beta version of New Jersey Career Network was released in January, 2020 and incorporates a modern, mobile-responsive website that will eventually guide job-seekers to career services and digital tools such as virtual coaching, lifelong learning opportunities, and career management tools, as well as an expert system to match job seekers and other users to the programs and services most relevant to them based on where they are in their job search journey.

 The goal of the Claimant Experience Pilot is to design an application system that provides equitable and timely access to unemployment benefits for eligible workers, while rooting out identity theft and other fraud issues that have bogged down state unemployment systems throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commissioner Asaro-Angelo recognized early in the pandemic the need for federal reforms to streamline and simplify the cumbersome and sometimes arbitrary criteria claimants are required to meet each week to continue to receive benefits. In September 2020, he wrote a letter to New Jersey's Congressional Delegation outlining critical reforms needed at the federal level, some of which are now being tackled under this pilot program from the Biden Administration.

I say this even as our Department consistently leads the nation in the percentage of unemployed residents who receive benefits in a state that has the highest percentage of workers who were eligible for traditional unemployment insurance." He added, "These changes to the system can help us deliver benefits more efficiently and fairly in the future -- all the time, not just at the height of a crisis."

While states mobilized quickly to implement crucial new federal pandemic unemployment programs, agencies across the nation were hamstrung by inflexible technology that was not built to handle the crush of claims we received nor the dozens of changes to the federal programs made during the pandemic.

 New Jersey was chosen to lead this national effort for several reasons: The state consistently leads the nation in the percentage of unemployed workers who successfully receive benefits; NJDOL has established a successful working relationship with USDOL and USDS; it has received an extraordinary number of unemployment applications (2.4 million) since March of 2020; and it found innovative solutions to paying benefits during the past 21 months, a time of unprecedented demand.
