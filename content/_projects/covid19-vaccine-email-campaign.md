title: Vaccine Hesitancy Email Campaign
initiative: COVID Response
---

Following the release of the first-ever COVID-19 vaccine, the Office of Innovation, in partnership with NJ Department of Health and numerous other partners, developed and implemented a statewide eight message email campaign designed to address vaccine hesitancy concerns.

### Challenge



### Innovation In Action

The Office of Innovation worked with academic partners and public health experts to research key motivations that drove people’s decision-making regarding whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This research was further informed by several A/B tests to validate and iterate on the campaign’s proposed approaches. To increase the campaign’s reach, OOI also coordinated across State departments and agencies to leverage pre-existing distribution channels to connect with a broader, more diverse audience.

### Impact + Metrics

-   The vaccine hesitancy campaign reached 5.4 million New Jerseyans; a total of 41.8 million emails were sent, generating more than 18.7 million impressions
-   More 5 million subscribers stayed engaged throughout the campaign, with only 5% of the total the audience unsubscribing at any point.
-   The email campaign directly drove more than 132,000 visits to the State’s Vaccine Appointment Finder, as well as more than 200,000 additional visits to the COVID-19 Information Hub
-   During the campaign timeline, 803,000 additional New Jerseyans became fully vaccinated
