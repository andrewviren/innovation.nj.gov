Our team members wear many hats, contributing to both the execution of core projects and the evolution of the Office of Innovation. We use data and modern research, design, and development methods to inform our decision making, and we collaborate with stakeholders within and outside of government to understand and solve challenges. 
This role is part of the C+E Lab - an initiative of the Office of Innovation to better connect residents with State government benefits, programs, services, and products. The C+E Lab uses consumer marketing techniques to change how government communicates to focus on what residents care about most.
The C+E Lab’s work is informed by three core tenets:
- Improving the quality of the State's marketing execution
- Building capacity in the State to market to residents
- Improving the ability of State stakeholders to effectively market to residents
