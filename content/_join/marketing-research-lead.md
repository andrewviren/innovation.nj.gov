The New Jersey State Office of Innovation’s Communication and Engagement (C+E) Lab is looking for a Marketing Research Lead to research, design, and implement marketing research initiatives that better connect residents with State government benefits, programs, services, and products. You will create impact by understanding what motivates residents and transforming findings into insights and approaches that move people to action. 
You will be part of an innovative, dedicated, and high-performing team driven to change how the government communicates and create better outcomes for residents. You’ll have the unique opportunity to work at the intersection of public service and modern marketing best practices and shape the direction of this work as you go along. 

### About the Office of Innovation

The New Jersey State Office of Innovation improves the lives of New Jerseyans by solving public problems differently. Our work spans numerous issue and policy areas, and is focused on making an impact in the lives of the New Jerseyans that we serve. Our work has decreased the amount of time it takes to apply for Unemployment Insurance, made it easier to start, operate, and grow a business in the Garden State, and connected millions of New Jerseyans to government programs, services, and benefits.
Our team members wear many hats, contributing to both the execution of core projects and the evolution of the Office of Innovation. We use data and modern research, design, and development methods to inform our decision making, and we collaborate with stakeholders within and outside of government to understand and solve challenges. 
This role is part of the C+E Lab - an initiative of the Office of Innovation to better connect residents with State government benefits, programs, services, and products. The C+E Lab uses consumer marketing techniques to change how government communicates to focus on what residents care about most.
The C+E Lab’s work is informed by three core tenets:
- Improving the quality of the State's marketing execution
- Building capacity in the State to market to residents
- Improving the ability of State stakeholders to effectively market to residents
